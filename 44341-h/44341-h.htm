<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Preface
to Second Edition.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1881, when the Royal
Agricultural Society held their show in Derby, it was represented
to me that, as many of the members were interested in the cheap
transport offered by narrow gauge railways, it would be
appreciated if I opened my experimental line at Duffield to
inspection during the week.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the comprehension of the objects of
this little railway, the late Secretary of the Society suggested
that I should draw up a short descriptive pamphlet to place in
the hands of visitors. This was done with success and much saving
of verbal explanation.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, having added considerably to the rolling
stock and improved many of the details, I decided to give a three
days exhibition, and to issue a general invitation to all
interested in the promotion of such lines, at the same time
taking the opportunity to revise and amplify the first edition of
this pamphlet.</p>

<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Preface
to Third Edition.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> four years have elapsed since
the second edition of this pamphlet was exhausted. During this
period I have constructed and equipped at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, a
line which has been in regular use since May, 1896, exactly
similar to my own at Duffield. This railway having been made
wholly for practical purposes and on strictly economic
principles, I am in a position to present more reliable data,
both in regard to cost and working, than I could obtain from my
own experimental line, which has been continually altered and
only irregularly worked.</p>
<p>I desire to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to
the Duke of Westminster for the free hand accorded me in regard
to the arrangement of all details of the Eaton Railway; a liberty
which has resulted in a symmetrical and entirely successful
carrying out of the work.</p>
<p>What I am now able to advance will, I trust, amply demonstrate
the really solid advantages which, under suitable conditions, may
be reaped from the installation of little railways of the kind
described.</p>

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span><span

INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the outset I must offer an
apology for making use, throughout this pamphlet, of the first
person. I do so partly for convenience of expression, and partly
because almost all that I have to advance is derived from my own
experience.&nbsp; In doing so I am far from desiring to
undervalue the work of others in the same direction. I have,
however, little hesitation in saying that, with the exception of
the late Mr. Charles Spooner, the able Engineer of the Festiniog
Railway, most of those, so far as I know, who are responsible for
the design of plant for these small lines have been manufacturers
whose productions, though often of fair workmanship, are clearly
indicative of a failure to grasp many of the leading principles
involved. This shortcoming is the natural result of a want of
sufficient time for the consideration of details, and a
consequent tendency to imitate established customs in regard to
railway work which by no means apply with equal advantage to very
narrow gauges, where the conditions involved are wholly
different. This is especially true of small locomotive building,
the specimens of which evidence in their design not only
ignorance on important points, but also a deplorable absence of
the sense of well-balanced proportion.</p>
<p>I venture to think that, in the twenty-five years during which
I have devoted much of my time to the subject, I have succeeded
in bringing to considerable perfection both permanent way and
rolling stock suitable for these diminutive lines, and more
especially the locomotives, which are probably, for their weight,
the most powerful and flexible ever built to work by simple
adhesion. Whether this conceit be well founded or no I leave to
the judgment of those who may be at the pains to acquaint
themselves with the details and result of my work, which has been
undertaken wholly as a labour of love with the sole desire to
promote improvement in what I believe to be an entirely special
branch of engineering. I have never <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>wasted my money on patents, and, so
long as my designs are not imitated in a bungling manner, I am
glad to see them made use of by anyone to whom they may be of
service.</p>
<p>It must be understood that I do not here attempt to enter upon
the comparative merits of narrow gauge railways generally, but
merely to give particulars of what has come within my own
experience. To facilitate a comprehension of the conditions under
which I have worked, it will be well to explain that I make no
pretension to be considered a professional engineer, and that I
speak rather as a self-taught mechanic and surveyor.</p>
<p>My father possessed a beautiful Holtzappfel lathe, with
elaborate tools for ornamental turning in wood and metal. As a
boy of seven or eight I can recall watching him as he worked. At
ten years old I was promoted to stand on a box and turn
candlesticks, but, a year or two later, a few lessons&mdash;the
only direct practical instruction I ever had&mdash;from an old
fishing-rod maker in chasing metal screw-threads begot in me an
ardent desire to construct machinery, particularly anything
pertaining to railways, for which from my childhood I had an
absorbing craze.</p>
<p>By my father&rsquo;s kindness I, by-and-bye, fitted up a
workshop in which the tools were driven by a half-horse steam
engine; and at eighteen had completed my first locomotive,
weighing 56 lbs., which, with a dozen or so of small wagons, made
a fine show on some 40 yards of brass-railed permanent way of 4
in. gauge. Locomotive driving was my hobby when I went up to
Cambridge, and many were the tips that I learned in my illicit
journeyings on the footplate. The new degree of &ldquo;Applied
Science&rdquo; had just made its appearance, in which, in 1871, I
had the doubtful credit of appearing alone in the first class.
Doubtful, because the papers were absurdly simple, and the
examiners hardly educated beyond the bare theories of the
mechanical processes; for it was long anterior to the days of
Professor Stuart and his engineering laboratory, where,
by-the-bye, I once remember seeing the &ldquo;demonstrator&rdquo;
supervising the reduction of a 4 in. shaft on a stout 9 or 10 in.
lathe by a young turner whose nervous and thread-like shavings
would have ensured his speedy dismissal from any commercial
machine-shop.</p>
<p>When I settled at Duffield in 1872, I at once began to put
into practice the views I had formed in regard to the possibility
of advantageously superseding horse traction, in cases where a
traffic, though heavy, was wholly insufficient to justify a more
costly railway, by a line of the narrowest and consequently the
cheapest gauge compatible with safety. It is to a setting forth
of the results of my experiments during the years that have since
elapsed, that the following pages are devoted. My claim to a
hearing is chiefly based upon having always been <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>my own
draughtsman, and, for my first two larger locomotives, also
moulder, machinist, and fitter. Owing to the increasing number of
experiments, and to other calls upon my time, assistance
eventually became necessary, and, though I am still conceited
enough to keep the more delicate manipulations in my own hands,
so far as I can find time to execute them, it has gradually come
about that I have seven or eight artisans in the little
workshops. Practical acquaintance with every detail both in
survey, design, and construction of narrow-gauge railways has
given me something of a pull over the professional engineer. Thus
it happens that, without the credit of any exceptional ability, I
have had advantages that fall to few of acquiring information
which I desire to lay before those who are interested in the
rapid and economical transport of a moderate annual tonnage.</p>
<p>The first three sections of this pamphlet comprise a brief
sketch of the purposes, origin, and construction of my own line.
In Section IV. is given a detailed account of the construction,
working, and cost of the similar line which I made to connect
Eaton Hall with the Great Western Railway. Sections V., VI.,
VII., and VIII. are more technical, and may be passed over by
those not interested in the mechanical details, although it is to
the care that has been bestowed on these that my success is
chiefly attributable. Section IX. deals, from such experience as
I have acquired, with the conditions under which these small
railways may be profitably installed. In Section X. I have
appended a few further items of possible interest.</p>
<h2><span class="GutSmall">II.</span><br />
OBJECTS OF THE 15 IN. GAUGE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, in 1874, I started on the
construction of my experimental railway, the more notable
narrow-gauge lines in our own country were those of 18 in. at
Crewe, Woolwich, Chatham, and Aldershot&mdash;the latter a sad
failure and the admirable 23&frac12; in. from Portmadoc to the
Festiniog Slate Quarries. The Festiniog Railway, which owed its
success as a locomotive-worked line to the persistent energy and
ability of the late Mr. Charles Spooner, opened the eyes <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>of the
transport-interested world to the extraordinary capacity of a
very narrow gauge. But here the marvel lies in the manner in
which the work was adapted to the gauge, not in the suitability
of the gauge to the work. No one but an enthusiast would dare to
contend that a two-foot gauge was the ideal width for a line
employing twenty-ton locomotives and hauling about 100,000
passengers and some 150,000 tons of minerals and goods per annum.
If this development could have been foreseen, the selected gauge
would doubtless have been wider. Such a traffic, however, is
quite outside the scope of this pamphlet, the logic of which is
directed to shewing how a much smaller annual tonnage than has
been hitherto deemed worthy of a railway may be profitably thus
conveyed.</p>
<p>An 18 in. line, such as one of those above referred to, would,
if of not more than three or four miles in length and tolerably
level, be capable of transporting, with one locomotive, 60,000
tons of minerals annually, reckoning the traffic as in one
direction only. There are, however, up and down the country, a
number of cases where a traffic of from 5,000 to 10,000 tons is
annually hauled between two fixed points over the public highways
by a single employer. Such cases may be classified as large
mansions, public institutions, mines, quarries, &amp;c. Now it is
clear that, unless there is a prospect of large increase in the
traffic, it would be absurd to employ for a maximum of 10,000
tons a railway equal to 60,000 tons, and so the question
arises:&mdash;What is the smallest and therefore the cheapest
railway capable of being practically and advantageously worked?
This is the question to which I venture to think I can give a
reliable answer.</p>
<p>In the year 1874, after various preliminary trials, I
determined to construct a line of 15 in. gauge, as the smallest
width possessing the necessary stability for practical use,
although I once laid down one of 9 in. gauge for my younger
brothers, which proved by no means deficient in carrying
power.</p>
<p>The stability of this 9 in. line was perfect enough so long as
persons did not attempt to ride on the ends and edges of the
carriages and wagons, but man being an article of approximately
standard size, it is clear there must be a minimum gauge which
will be stable enough to be independent of such liberties.</p>
<p>Rolling stock properly proportioned to a 15 in. gauge seems
the smallest that will thoroughly insure safety in this respect,
and indeed in France the late M. D&eacute;cauville, who did so
much to develop lines of this class, arrived at nearly similar
conclusions in adopting a minimum width of 16 in.</p>
<p>It must not, of course, be understood that gauges of such
small proportions are to be advocated except where the traffic is
unlikely to increase beyond their capacity, and where the
material to be moved can conveniently be loaded in moderate sized
wagons.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Feeling, however, convinced of the eventual recognition
of the utility of lines of minimum gauge, I took some pains to
become acquainted with what had been already achieved in this
direction, with the result that, excepting only the Festiniog
railway, where every detail was most ably worked out by the late
Mr. Spooner, I found generally both road and rolling-stock
constructed as mere imitations of those of the standard gauge,
and showing a want of apprehension of the totally different
conditions to be satisfied. To endeavour to solve the various
problems involved in the successful design of engines, carriages,
wagons, and roadway for a minimum gauge is, therefore, the main
object of my little railway. The chief ends in view are the
application of such lines to agricultural or commercial purposes
on large estates, or where quarries, brick yards, and other
industrial establishments need better connection with the pier or
railway station from which their productions are forwarded. An
excellent example of such a line is now to be found in the one I
have constructed at Eaton Hall, particulars of which are given in
Section IV. There were also problems relating to adhesion and
friction, particularly from the narrow-gauge point of view, which
I was desirous of solving, some remarks on which will be found in
Section VIII.</p>
<h2><span class="GutSmall">III.</span><br />
CONSTRUCTION OF THE DUFFIELD BANK LINE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> construction of my line of 15
in. gauge was commenced in 1874, and various additions were made
up to 1881, when the length laid amounted to a little over a
mile, inclusive of sidings. Since the latter date there has been
no material extension, but the permanent way and its accessories
have been gradually improved.</p>
<p>The line runs from the farm and workshops, up a gradient
varying from 1 in 10 to 1 in 12 about a quarter-of-a-mile long,
to a level 80 ft. above, where the experimental course is laid
out in the shape of a figure 8, so as to admit of continuous
runs. This part, somewhat more than half-a-mile in length, has a
level stretch of a quarter-of-a-mile, the remainder consisting of
gradients, of which 1 in 20 is the most severe. The minimum curve
on the main line is 25 ft. radius, but in the sidings some occur
as sharp as 15 ft. radius.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The
permanent way was at first laid with 14 lb. rails, without
fish-plates, spiked to elm and Spanish chestnut sleepers fallen
and sawn on the premises, 5 in. wide, 2 in. thick, and 2 ft. 6
in. long, set at 1 ft. 6 in. centres. The maximum load did not
exceed 12 cwt. per axle, but, although the work was well done,
the road was not equal to the weight, and required incessant
attention. The line was then re-laid on sleepers 6&frac12; in.
wide, 4 in. thick, and 3 ft. long, with various sections of
rails, 12 lbs., 14 lbs., 18 lbs., and 22 lbs. per yard. These
were all fitted with fish-plates, the joints being on a sleeper.
The spacing of the sleepers was varied with the rails, from 1 ft.
6 in. for the 12 lb. to 3 ft. for the 22 lb. section. Any part of
this road carries comfortably 25 cwt. per axle. The fish-plates
and larger area of sleeper more than doubled the original
carrying power of the rails.</p>
<p>Six years being about the life of these small sleepers, it
soon became necessary to renew them. Seeing that the rails, owing
to the light traffic, remained perfectly good, to have to pull
the road to pieces for the sake of new sleepers only was a
serious annoyance. I then determined to try a light cast-iron
sleeper with the same bearing area. After some years of
experiment, a thoroughly satisfactory one was perfected, in which
the rail is held to its place by a curved steel spring key that
cannot work out. The greater part of the line is now laid on
these cast-iron sleepers, which weigh 28 lbs. each, inclusive of
the chairs, which are cast on. This pattern has now had some
eighteen years&rsquo; test, and has proved entirely satisfactory.
With a 14 lb. steel rail, the sleepers being spaced 2 ft. 3 in.,
and at the suspended fish-joint 1 ft. 3 in., the road, under the
load of 25 cwt. per axle, requires very little repair, some parts
having stood for five or six years without being touched, though
constantly run over.</p>
<p>The length of the sleeper is a very material point. It should
project beyond the rail a distance of rather more than half the
gauge of the line thus the rail is equally supported inside and
out. When the projection is reduced, the centre of the sleepers
cannot be packed up solid, because the support would then be
greatest between the rails, with the result that the ballast
below would assume a convex form lengthwise of the sleepers, and
thus produce an unstable road. On lines of the standard gauge, if
sleepers of this proportion were adopted, and of sufficient
thickness to distribute the load more widely without bending, a
great saving in repairs would be effected; but it is not likely
that any permanent way official will be bold enough to suggest
such a radical change. On the Festiniog Railway of 23&frac12; in.
gauge, a sleeper 4 ft. 6 in. long has been adopted with excellent
results.</p>
<p>A detail of importance in laying rails is that the joints
should be opposite one another. For this purpose it is necessary
to order a proportion of the rails 3 in. to 6 in. shorter than
the rest, according to the gauge and radius of curves. In this
way the joints can be kept practically square. A cross-jointed
road is not only unpleasant <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to travel on, but is also exceedingly
difficult to set up true, particularly on sharp curves.</p>
<p>Steel rails are now almost universally employed, but it is
worth attention that on any part of a line that is either very
damp or rarely used, iron rails will long outlast steel ones, as
every mining engineer knows.</p>
<p>In regard to the most suitable length of rail, I have found 15
ft. very convenient for weights up to 18 lbs. per yard. A good
deal depends upon whether the rails come from the makers properly
straightened. The longer the rail, the more difficult it is to
straighten; as a rule even the most careful specification will
fail to bring them on the ground in a fit condition for use. It
is a very usual thing to look at rails only in regard to their
horizontal truth, but in reality the vertical correction is of
far more importance, and, to detect this, the rail must be turned
on its side. I cannot too strongly insist on the vital importance
of laying only straight and level rails. A good running road can
never be made if any humpy rails are laid, and it is quite
impossible to subsequently rectify the defect without taking up
such rails and treating them under the press. Rail-straighteners
should be directed to level a rail before straightening it, that
is, to correct it vertically first, then horizontally; the reason
being that vertical pressing disturbs the horizontal truth, while
the horizontal pressing does not affect the vertical
accuracy.</p>
<p>I have employed a rail-press fitted up on a wagon, specially
arranged with drilling machine for fish bolt holes, with tool
boxes, and a brake. The screw works horizontally, and the rail
runs on adjustable rollers at each end of the wagon. The amount
of curve is thus readily appreciated by the eye as the process
proceeds, while with a vertical screw it is scarcely possible to
judge correctly. For sharp curves I use a roller bender of a type
I designed many years ago for the use of the Royal Engineers in
their field railway experiments. In this machine, which consists
of the usual three rollers with the centre one adjustable by a
screw, two men wind the rail through, and, except at the extreme
ends, effect a perfect curve. This machine, however, is of little
use for the ordinary straightening, and, though saving some time
on a long curve, is laborious to work. A curve made under the
ordinary screw-press is of course really a succession of what are
technically termed &ldquo;dog-legs,&rdquo; but, unless it be of
smaller radius than one chain, these are imperceptible if the
successive pressures are not applied more than about 14 ins.
apart. By pressing at still smaller intervals it is possible to
produce sharper curves of reasonable truth, but I find the rails
on such curves work smoother and wear better if bent with the
roller machine.</p>
<p>Rails can be laid round moderate curves without requiring to
be bent, by screwing up the fish plates tight and then springing
the rail. The extent to which <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>this can be effected depends on the
weight of the rail and on its length; the longer rail being the
more accommodating. It is not advisable to attempt to spring a 14
lb. rail round a sharper curve than five chains, or an 18 lb.
rail beyond ten chains radius.</p>
<p>The result of attempting too much springing is that the rails,
under the traffic and changes of temperature, work outwards at
the joints and make &ldquo;dog legs&rdquo; more or less serious.
Where the ballast is of a loose dry nature very little, if
anything, can be done with springing. I have enlarged upon this
subject of rail-laying because it is of prime importance to a
good road, and a matter that, on narrow-gauge lines, does not
receive the attention it requires.</p>
<p>To return to a description of my line, there are on it three
tunnels, two bridges, and a viaduct 91 feet long and 20 feet
high. The latter was erected in 1878, as an improvement upon one
at Aldershot, put up by a gentleman who induced the War Office to
sanction a short experimental line for army transport upon a
hopelessly inconvenient and ridiculous plan.</p>
<p>My structure is of pitch pine, and stood for 16 years without
repair. It is a trestle bridge, the trestles being so designed
that each member is a multiple of the height. The roadway is
carried on four timbers; formerly, for a 8 ton engine, 11 in.
deep and 8 in. wide; now, for one of 5 tons, 13 in. deep and
3&frac12; in. wide. These are bolted together in pairs, one pair
under each rail, the two being kept parallel by stretchers and
through bolts at every 5 feet. In each pair the timbers break
joint with one another on alternate trestles, the latter being 15
ft. apart, and each timber 30 ft. long. The advantages of this
arrangement are two-fold, the timbers can be run forward from
trestle to trestle as the work advances without scaffolding or
lifting tackle, and, should one trestle sink out of line, the
continuity of the upper work checks it, and obviates the
dangerous &ldquo;dog legs&rdquo; to be almost invariably observed
in this class of bridge. The original cost with the lighter
timbers was &pound;30, including every item of
expenditure&mdash;equal to &pound;1 per yard. The average height
is 15 ft. The details are arranged to require but little skilled
labour, the connections being made entirely by bolts and cast
angle-plates. Two carpenters, in five days framed the five
trestles including cutting the timber to length; and in three
more days, with the assistance of three labourers, the whole was
erected and the rails laid ready for traffic. A platform and
railing were, however, subsequently added for the convenience of
foot passengers, thus materially increasing the cost. When
rebuilt in 1894 with stronger timbers, the original trestles were
retained.</p>
<p>Where the line crosses field-fences a dyke is dug about 5 to 6
ft. square and 3 ft. deep, across which the rails are carried on
two narrow girders, thus effectually <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>preventing the passage of cattle, and
avoiding both the delay of gates and the expense of side
fencing.</p>
<p>The line is properly equipped with interlocking signals and
points on a very simple plan. These are for the most part worked
from two signal-boxes in telephonic communication.</p>
<p>Particulars of the cost of such a line will be found in
Sections IV. and IX. On my experimental course there are six
stations, at three of which are sheds for the accommodation of
the rolling stock. When the line is used on the occasion of a
garden party, a regular service of passenger trains is run, and
several times trains of eight long bogie cars, carrying 120
passengers, have been hauled up the gradient of 1 in 20, and up
the still more trying one of 1 in 47 situate on a
three-quarter-circle curve of 40 ft. radius.</p>
<p>In the year 1894 I exhibited the line to the engineering
public during three days. On this occasion a variety of
experiments in haulage and shunting were shewn, and for part of
each day two trains were run concurrently.</p>

DETAILS OF THE EATON HALL LINE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the exhibition of my railway
at Duffield in 1894, one of the visitors was the Hon. Cecil
Parker, agent to the Duke of Westminster, who was desirous of
laying some sort of light railway from Eaton Hall to the Great
Western Railway, three miles distant. It was necessary that the
line should be unobtrusive in appearance, of a thoroughly
permanent character, yet moderate in cost. The traffic was, as it
proved, correctly estimated at from 5,000 to 6,000 tons annually.
Here was a perfect opportunity for a practical experiment with
the 15 in. gauge, which was ample for five times that amount. I
was asked to inspect the route, and subsequently roughly
estimated the cost, exclusive of buildings, at about
&pound;6,000. I had some doubt at first whether it was possible
for me to find time to lay out and construct the whole line and
rolling stock myself, but the difficulty of getting special
designs effectively carried out by commercial firms at a
reasonable cost decided me to undertake everything. It was at my
desire eventually agreed that I should have <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>a free hand
in regard to all the designs, doing the work at cost price and
without charge for my own time.</p>
<p>The line will now be generally described, after which some of
the more interesting details will be enlarged upon.</p>
<p>The Eaton estate railway connects the Hall with the Great
Western Railway at Balderton, 3 miles distant. The total length
of line laid is 4&frac12; miles, which includes, besides the main
line, a branch <sup>&frac34;</sup> mile in length to the estate
works near Pulford, together with several shorter branches to the
estate brickyard and other points. The traffic to be dealt with,
consisting chiefly of coal, road metal, and building material,
was computed at about 6,000 tons per annum. As it was desired
that the line should be as inconspicuous as possible, since it
had to cross the park and the three principal drives, and the
required capacity being small, it was decided to adopt the 15 in.
gauge.</p>
<p>The line is laid with steel flat-bottomed rails, weighing
16&frac12; lbs. per yard, and, to reduce repairs to a minimum,
these are carried throughout on cast-iron sleepers, 3 ft. long,
6&frac12; in. wide, weighing 28 lbs., and coated with
anti-corrosive. Steel spring-keys secure the rails in jaws cast
on the sleepers, which are spaced at 2 feet 3 inches centres,
and, at the joints, at 1 ft. 4 in. Steel girders, on cast-iron
foundation plates, are used for all the bridge-work. Thus no
timber whatever is employed in the permanent way, and the
depreciation is practically limited to wear of rails.</p>
<p>The rails for the points are rivetted on to flat-topped
cast-iron sleepers, and were built up in my workshops, and
forwarded ready for laying down. A set of points with seven
sleepers carrying them, and with lever, counterweight, base
plate, and the necessary rods, weighs about 4 cwts., and costs
&pound;7 15s. 0d. All the switches are planed out of the solid,
and the crossings are of cast steel. Special cast-iron sleepers
are employed on the girder bridges. These are of bar form, having
below a cross-piece which is tightened up to the sleeper by two
bolts, and which grips the inner flange of each girder. It is
thus possible to set the rails to any moderate curve, on straight
girders. For crossing roads a short and very strong sleeper, only
2 feet in length, is employed, with jaws fitted to take a second
rail on each side to act as a guard-rail to the running one.
These sleepers have a concrete foundation, and are packed to the
required level with tarred macadam. The spaces are then filled in
with the same material, and the road finished to a surface level
with the top of the rails with a mixture of tar, pitch, and
screenings. The flange space is of course left free; this is
1&frac12; in. wide so as to avoid any chance of the shoes of
draft horses jamming therein. The field crossings, to permit of
carts crossing the line at convenient points in the various
fields, are arranged with a similar <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>double rail, but on a specially
strong sleeper of the standard length, packed with ordinary
ballast.</p>
<p>The ballast is red furnace cinder, 5 to 6 in. in depth below
the sleepers. The surface width is 4 ft., and through the park
the top of the ballast is level with the turf, the drainage here
being effected by a central 4 in. pipe. The appearance is thus
that of a narrow garden walk. For the remainder of the route,
which is entirely over grass land with a stiff clay subsoil, the
ballast is above ground.</p>
<p>The railway is unfenced throughout, and passes from field to
field on short open girders with a dyke excavated below, thus
preventing the passage of cattle. Two high roads besides the
three drives are crossed on the level, and several brooks by
girder bridges, the longest span being 28 ft. The line is
practically a surface one, there being few noticeable cuttings
and embankments. The cost of the earthwork has been &pound;205
per mile. The maximum gradient against the load is 1 in 70, the
highest point of the line is 63 ft. above the lowest, and the
Eaton terminus is 51 ft. above the junction with the Great
Western Railway. The curves on the main line do not run below 300
ft. in radius, but curves of 60 ft. radius, and, at difficult
points, of still less, occur at some of the termini and on the
branches. At Eaton a large covered coal stove 80 ft. long and 33
ft. wide has been erected, so arranged that the little wagons run
in at a high level and readily discharge their contents.</p>
<p>The rolling stock, which is all capable of traversing a
minimum curve of 25 ft. radius, is fitted throughout with
self-acting coupler-buffers, and all similar parts are
interchangeable. It comprises the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>One four-coupled locomotive weighing 3 tons in working order,
and carrying enough water and fuel for an hour&rsquo;s
running.</p>
<p>Thirty wagons 6 ft. long, 3 ft. wide, 1 ft. 3 in. deep,
weighing each 7&frac12; cwts., and holding 16 to 17 cwts. of
coal, or 20 to 22 cwts. of bricks and road metal. The sides are
of box form and removable, so that the floors can be used as flat
wagons for the conveyance of large stones, castings, &amp;c.
Fittings are attachable to any wagon for carrying long timber.
Also one bogie passenger car 20 ft. long and 3 ft. 6 in. wide,
weighing 23 cwts. and seating 16 persons, and one parcel van, to
carry 2 tons, of approximately similar construction.</p>
<p>Various other vehicles; among which are a brake van, 6 wagons
capable of carrying 1&frac12; tons each, and 2 for 2 tons each.
Full particulars of the construction of the rolling-stock, now
increased, will be found in Sections V. and VI.</p>
<p>The gross load which the engine, exclusive of its own weight,
will haul in regular work is 40 tons on the level, and 20 tons up
the ruling gradient of 1 in 70; the speed being about 10 miles
per hour. In an experimental trip, however, a <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>speed of 20
miles per hour was attained without undue oscillation. This
weight of train is by no means the limit which can be hauled on
the line, for, on the Duffield Bank railway, the
eight-wheel-coupled engine draws far more than this load, and on
one occasion took eight bogie passenger cars carrying 124 persons
up a gradient of 1 in 47 on which is a half-circle curve of only
40 ft. radius.</p>
<p>The entire cost of construction has been &pound;1,095 per
mile, exclusive of sheds. This figure would have been materially
less but for the considerable expense attending the extra
levelling and turfing required to avoid undue prominence. The
cost of rolling stock has been &pound;214 per mile, thus bringing
the total outlay to &pound;1,309 per mile.</p>

<p>The cost of loading being the same for railway wagons as for
carts is not considered. With a minimum traffic of 5,000 tons per
annum over an average distance of 2&frac12; miles&mdash;equal to
12,500 ton-miles&mdash;the cost of transport is almost precisely
1s. per ton per mile; which is materially less than the cost of
the cart haulage. The same rolling-stock and staff could readily
deal with 40 tons per working day of eight hours&mdash;equal, at
five days per week, to upwards of 10,000 tons a year. If the
traffic were to reach this amount, the cost per ton of transport
would be greatly reduced With a more powerful engine and
additional rolling stock, such a line is capable of conveying an
annual traffic of 40,000 tons.</p>
<p>There are probably many localities in which a diminutive
railway like that at Eaton, ample in its capacity for estate
requirements and extremely flexible in threading existing
buildings, would well repay construction. The unobtrusiveness of
so small a line and rolling stock, the relief to the roads, and
the convenience of constant connection with the nearest railway,
are points which are deserving of consideration where the
conditions make such an installation possible.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>The
laying of the line was begun in August, 1895. The earthwork was
already well advanced. On account of the large amount of game in
the neighbourhood of the line, it was considered wiser to employ
no contractor, nor were any men obtainable with a knowledge of
such diminutive platelaying. For the first fortnight I worked
away myself with beater, rammer, and crowbar, till I had taught a
proportion of my staff of 16 the use of these tools, and how to
put the permanent way together. My assistant engineer, new to
railway work, soon picked up the right ideas of what was
required, and in a month, when I had to leave, everything was
going nicely. A bonus was paid on every rail-length beyond a
quarter-of-a-mile per week completed. This, compared with the
fine work done by the Royal Engineers in the Soudan, appears a
poor performance, but it must be remembered that we had to bring
not only rails and sleepers from our base, but also all the
ballast, and that we left our work thoroughly packed, the banks
soiled and turfed, the road crossings laid in concrete and
asphalte with double rails and special sleepers, the
field-crossings for carts made good, the girder bridges and fence
bridges (cattle stops) erected, and all points and crossings
permanently finished off. About Christmas we reached Eaton Hall,
and in the following May (1896) had pretty well finished all the
branches.</p>
<p>Of course work done with such care and by the day was costly,
and it would doubtless be possible to construct a similar line by
contract at two-thirds of the price. But it is a question whether
much would have been saved in the long run, for, except the usual
platelayers&rsquo; work, no repairs of any sort have been
necessary since completion, nor has any part of the mechanism
failed or given trouble; a result not usually attained in
contract work.</p>
<p>It may interest those who have similar work to deal with if I
explain that in making this line all our material had to be
hauled from our base on the Great Western Railway at Balderton.
The procedure was as follows:&mdash;At the rail-end four 15 ft.
lengths of light timber framing 9 in. deep were laid on the bare
formation. A train then backed up with eight wagons of ballast,
and on top of them four lengths of rail ready keyed to sleepers.
The rails were lifted off alongside where they were to be laid,
the &ldquo;tops&rdquo; of the wagons were removed and the ballast
shovelled off on each side. The train then drew away to refill.
The length of framing next the rail-end was lifted forward to the
end of furthest framing, and so consecutively with the other
three, thus leaving between the rail end and the fresh laid
framing a space of 60 ft. with the loose ballast lying thereon.
Four men with shovels and four with rammers then put the ballast
in shape and rammed it solid, and also true to a level given by
the engineer. The rails and sleepers were next lifted into place,
and the fish plates affixed. The sleepers next the joints were
temporarily packed, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>by which time a fresh train had arrived. The process was
then repeated. In this manner, with a staff of ten men at the
rail-end, a driver and boy with the train, six men loading
ballast, three men straightening and bending rails, and three
fixing them in sleepers, 60 ft. were laid in about forty minutes,
including delays for field crossings and cattle-stop bridges.
After a day or two of this work the men were set to packing and
finishing what had been laid. With a larger staff the two
processes might, but less conveniently, have proceeded at the
same time.</p>

doubtless somewhat expensive.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes simple wooden sheds would usually
answer every requirement, and the extra amount spent at Eaton on

omission of this item. As to the coal store this was altogether a

<p>The best Welsh smokeless coal is used, costing about &pound;1
per ton.</p>
<p>From the above figures the following deductions may be
drawn:&mdash;</p>
<p>The locomotive worked an average of 4 days per week, hauling
an average of 28 tons each day, and burning 1&frac34; cwts. of
coal at a cost of 1s. 9d.</p>
<p>Full particulars of the hauling powers of the locomotive are
given at the end of this section, where it will be seen that 70
tons a day can readily be dealt with, and that, in an emergency,
100 tons would be quite within reasonable compass.</p>
<p>It is required, at Eaton, that the engine should meet the
wants of several independent departments on the estate, and in
different directions, added to which only a limited number of men
are usually available for loading. In effect, instead of matters
being arranged primarily with a view to the economy of the
working of the railway, the railway is made an instrument for the
economical working of <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the various departments supplied by
it. There is doubtless much to be said for the view that, as the
driver&rsquo;s wages have to be paid, he may as well have his
engine in steam as often as required. But, notwithstanding this
easy mode of working the traffic, the cost of haulage is 3d. per
ton per mile less than the average cost of carting, including
interest on capital as well as working expenses.</p>
<p>I may say that the line is kept in the most admirable order,
clean, well packed, and neatly ballasted, and that, under the
astute direction of the Hon. Cecil Parker, the Duke&rsquo;s
agent, the painstaking Superintendent of the line, Mr. Forster,
records with the greatest accuracy the weight of every truck load
of goods hauled, and the exact amount of all expenditure on the
railway, thus giving a value to this somewhat novel experiment
which it would not otherwise possess.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the amount expended on
platelayers&rsquo; wages during 1896 exceeded the probably normal
sum spent in 1897, on account of the road not having become till
the latter year properly consolidated. The cinder ballast, though
admirably porous, has proved somewhat deficient in solidity, and
the sleepers have required a good deal more packing than should
have been necessary.</p>
<p>Since the completion of the line in May, 1896, some additions
have been made to the rolling-stock, with a view of obviating the
necessity for the immediate unloading of every wagon. There was a
strongly expressed idea among the employes that tip wagons would
be more serviceable than the box wagons with loose
&ldquo;tops&rdquo; supplied by me. I have always felt that the
greater dead-weight of the former class of wagons in proportion
to the load carried, and also their increased cost, heavily
discounted their only advantage: celerity in unloading. In order,
however, to bring the question to a definite proof, I constructed
six tip wagons entirely of steel and cast iron which are fully
described in Section VI. In practice these were found to work as
well as it is possible for a tip wagon to do, but, nevertheless,
the unloading advantages were wholly incommensurate with the
drawbacks of greater dead-weight and less capacity. There was the
further disability that a wagon of this class could not be used,
as can the others, for the conveyance of timber or other bulky
goods. In the end I removed all but two, which were left as
samples, and replaced them with wagons of the original type.</p>
<p>I conclude this account of the Eaton railway by giving
particulars of the trial trips of the small four-wheeled
locomotive and of its hauling powers, and also of a test
day&rsquo;s work on time line.</p>
<p>The trials of No. 4 locomotive at Eaton were carried out in
Sept., 1896, and the particulars were as follows (all weights
being accurately taken on the weighbridge):&mdash;</p>

<p>Time from start to stop, 21&frac12; mins.; speed, 8&frac12;
miles per hour. The first mile, <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>fairly level, was run at 6&frac14;
miles per hour only. The long gradient up to Eaton was run at
just under 10 miles per hour, the steam blowing off freely with
injector full on and damper three-quarters closed nearly all the
last mile-and-a-half.</p>
<p>Trip 6:&mdash;From 1&frac14; to 2&frac14; mile posts, chiefly
up gradient of 1 in 80. To test maximum running speed with light
trains. Load: bogie passenger-car and van only. The maximum speed
was attained on passing the 1&frac12; mile post, but fell off
slightly after passing the 1&frac34; post. Time by stop watch,
from 1&frac12; to 2 mile post, 1&frac12; mins. exactly. Average
speed, 20 miles per hour.</p>
<p>It is to be noted, since the 15 in. gauge is almost precisely
one-quarter that of the standard railway gauge, and since
possible speed is in direct proportion to gauge, that 10, 15, and
20 miles on the one equal 40, 60, and 80 on the other. Thus the
average speed of 10 to 12 miles per hour usually maintained,
including the road-crossing stop, by the mineral trains on the
Eaton line is considerably in excess of the proportionate speed
of similar trains on the standard railways.</p>
<p>In August, 1897, arrangements were courteously made at my
request by the Hon. Cecil Parker and by Mr. W. A. Forster, to
enable me to test the weight of minerals that could be
transported in a full day&rsquo;s work, over the three miles of
line from Balderton to Eaton. Care was taken to obviate any
delays in loading and unloading, but every truck had to be
weighed separately on leaving Balderton, a process occupying
about ten minutes with each train. Six trips were run during the
day, and 69 tons of coal and road-metal were transported. There
were four loaders at Balderton, and two unloaders at Eaton. The
trains consisted of 12 wagons and van. The average gross weight,
exclusive of engine, was about 17 tons, and the weight of
minerals, or paying load, 12 tons. The speed was just under 10
miles per hour for the loaded trains, and 11.5 miles per hour for
the empties. The engine left the shed at 8.15 a.m., and returned
at 5.45 p.m., with a delay of 55 minutes for dinner. The weather
was as bad as possible, slight showers all through the day making
the rails so greasy as to necessitate the constant use of sand up
the inclines. Time was also wasted in an extra journey for empty
wagons, and in other unavoidable delays. About 1 hour 10 minutes
was the average time taken over a trip out and back, reckoning to
the time of next start. It is thus apparent that, with a little
more arrangement, eight trips could have been run in the day. In
the earlier trips, the gross loads hauled were only about sixteen
tons, increasing later in the day to eighteen and nineteen tons.
These larger loads might just as well have been also hauled on
the earlier trips and it was apparent that, under less adverse
conditions, 100 tons of paying load could have been transported
in the day. Only 3 cwt. of coal was burned, including lighting
up. The total distance run was 41 miles, and the average
consumption of coal per mile, including that burned while
standing, was 83 lbs. For Eaton Railway Regulations see Appendix
C.</p>

LOCOMOTIVES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first locomotive put upon my
line was completed in 1875. This engine was constructed, not so
much as a model of what a small locomotive should be, as to
provide the requisite motive power for the experiments I desired
to carry out. No great care was, therefore, observed in the
details, and in its construction a good deal of material which
happened to be at hand was utilized to save time and expense;
this much in excuse of the want of proportion in some of the
dimensions, which will be found in detail under the head of No. 1
in the table of locomotive dimensions on page 31.</p>
<p>The boiler was of the launch type, a cylindrical shell with a
cylindrical fire-box terminating in tubes. This pattern of
boiler, though giving less heating surface for its size than one
of ordinary locomotive design, has the great merit of having no
fire-box projecting below the barrel, thus enabling the over-hang
of the frame beyond the wheel-base to be equalised at each end, a
matter of the first importance in small tank engines. Its low
first cost and the ease with which it can be kept in order are
additional advantages. So well was I satisfied with the working,
that in the four boilers since designed for my locomotives I have
adhered to the original plan, which was copied from some shunting
engines made by Mr. Ramsbottom for the London and North Western
Railway. I go so far as to think that, without getting rid of a
depending fire-box, no really satisfactory tank engine can be
constructed for a small gauge railway unless idle wheels are
introduced, a proceeding that cannot too strongly be deprecated.
The gradients, which are almost invariably the concomitants of
these small lines, make it essential that the whole of the
available weight should be utilized for adhesion.</p>
<p>The difficulty of carrying on four wheels a boiler of
sufficient length for a more powerful engine, and the
unsuitableness of an ordinary six-coupled engine to the sharp
curves in which narrow-gauge lines generally abound, led me, in
1877, to work out a design by which the wheel-base of an engine
of the latter type could be made to accommodate itself to any
required degree of curvature. At this time I was in communication
with officers engaged in promoting a scheme for an army field
railway, where great power conjoined with perfect flexibility was
essential. As the result, I constructed the engine of which the
dimensions are given under No. 2 in <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the table, this being put to work in
1881. While avoiding the complication of the double-bogie system,
this engine possesses most, if not all, of its advantages. It is
six-coupled in the ordinary way, the axles having outside
bearings and cranks. The wheels, of cast steel, are not fixed
upon the axles, but each pair is keyed upon a cast iron sleeve,
through which the axle passes. The sleeve upon the middle axle is
capable of sliding 1 in. in each direction laterally, but cannot
revolve upon its axle thus, when the engine reaches a curve, the
arc of the rail draws the middle wheels on their sleeve to an
amount equal to the versed sine of the arc, without interfering
with the rigid position of the axle. The leading and trailing
pairs are likewise mounted on sleeves, but here the connection of
the sleeve with the axle is by means of a ball joint at the
centre, so constructed as to leave the sleeve free to radiate in
any direction, but obliging it to revolve with the axle. The
middle sleeve is so connected by external hoops and links with
the leading and trailing sleeves that, when the former makes a
lateral diversion, the two latter are radiated precisely to the
required curve, providing it is within the limit of the travel of
the middle sleeve, which, in this case, is arranged for a radius
of 25 ft. This engine excited considerable interest among
visitors to my railway at the time of the Royal Agricultural Show
in Derby in 1881, but the opinion was expressed that the
arrangement would not stand hard work. A few years later,
however, when some officers of the Royal Engineers were trying
the engine with a view to adopting the plan on the military
railway at Chatham, they subjected it to very severe tests,
loading it up steep inclines to its utmost capacity; stopping it
with the steam brake almost dead when travelling at various
speeds and over the most awkward places; and, finally, giving it
a fifty mile run with all the load that could be got together, at
an average speed of seven and a half miles an hour, stops being
made for water, &amp;c., for twelve minutes in each hour. This
was followed, shortly after, by a continuous run with a similar
load for an hour and thirty-five minutes, the extreme limit to
which the water in the tanks would hold out.</p>
<p>There was no heating of any part during the trials, nor
failure of any kind. After eight years&rsquo; work, chiefly on
gradients of 1 in 10 to 1 in 12, where sand has to be used
freely, the engine came into the shops to be overhauled. During
this time there had been no mishap or breakage whatever, nor had
a wheel ever left the rails, except on one occasion in descending
the steep incline, when, owing to the slippery state of the
rails, and sand failing, the engine slid away and left the road;
less than an hour, however, sufficing to get it running
again.</p>
<p>On removing and examining, shortly after this, the working
parts of the radiating gear, they were found in perfect order,
the tool marks being still visible in the ball joints; and in
August, 1895, the engine, which was then sent over to do the
ballast <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>work on the Eaton Railway, where it worked for thirteen
months, showed still a clean bill of health. The engine is now
rebuilding, and it is proof of the excellence of the radiating
gear that this part is being put together again without
re-adjustment of any kind. There is thus no doubt of the success
of this radiating principle.</p>
<p>This engine is fitted, as already noticed, with a steam brake,
which can also be applied by hand but the latter alone is far too
slow in action for the abrupt stops necessary on a line like
mine.</p>
<p>The space between the frames being occupied by the radiating
arrangements, the valve gear is necessarily outside, and, to
avoid overhung eccentrics, I designed a modification of one of
Mr. Charles Brown&rsquo;s Swiss valve gears, which are also the
parents of what is known in this country as Joy&rsquo;s gear. I
venture to think that my plan, in which nothing projects below
the connecting-rod, is better suited to small engines where the
motion is almost always near the ground than any yet produced.
The gear is extremely simple, and has worked without any trouble,
the only setting required being the adjustment to length of the
valve spindles, and the setting of one fixed centre on each side
of the engine.</p>
<p>The springs consist of rubber pads placed between the axle-box
and the horn-block. They are simple to fit, take up no room,
never get out of order, and last many years. I have no
steel-carrying spring on any of my stock.</p>
<p>The safety-valve spring is entirely within the boiler, so that
it cannot be tampered with or injured by accident.</p>
<p>The connecting-rod brasses are peculiar. In order to avoid the
twist to the slide bar when the driving axle, owing to
inequalities in the road, fails to preserve its horizontal
parallelism with the frame, the brasses are shaped circular, so
as to turn slightly in their straps, the latter being bored out
in the direction of their length instead of slotted. This plan
not only relieves both crank-pin and slide-bar of torsion, but
also forms a much more rigid union between the strap and the rod
end.</p>
<p>The steam jet is worked by the regulator handle, the valve
being so arranged that when the handle is moved beyond the point
at which steam is shut off, the jet is opened. A spring stop
prevents the jet being opened inadvertently. Thus when steam is
put on, the jet is by the same action closed, steam is saved, and
two motions are performed in one.</p>
<p>An important point in this, as in all the locomotives I have
built, is that the over-hang at the two ends is equal, and the
weight also on both leading and trailing axles practically the
same, when the driver is on the foot plate. A further arrangement
of value is that in all my engines the cranks are
counter-balanced. It is impossible to effect the
counter-balancing on the wheels, nor, even if feasible, will the
result <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>be
so good, as counter-balance weights on the wheel are not at the
same distance from the axle centre as the disturbing weights, and
therefore not equable in their effect at different speeds.</p>
<p>This engine was built for tractive power, not speed, and
eighteen miles an hour is the highest rate registered over the
short straight course available. The previous engine, with
15&frac12; in. wheels, reached a speed equal to 23 miles an hour,
the time being in both cases taken over a measured distance with
a stop watch. About 11 miles an hour is the usual average speed
with passenger cars, which, owing to the severe curves, it is not
deemed wise to exceed.</p>
<p>The net cost of the engine under consideration was &pound;309,
exclusive of drawings and patterns. At the time it was built a
joiner and occasionally a labourer were my only assistants; the
work consequently proceeded but slowly, occupying altogether two
years and a half.&nbsp; Reducing the time to hours, the whole of
my own labour was almost precisely equal to that worked in one
year by an artisan, and that of my assistants together to about
half the amount. This includes the time occupied in moulding, for
all the castings were made on the premises, with the exception of
the steel wheels.</p>
<p>The boiler, frame-plates, and some of the brass fittings, were
purchased, but the whole of the machine work and fitting was
executed on the spot. The cost of all material, the hours of
labour and engine power, interest on tools, &amp;c., were all
carefully booked, and it will probably not be far from a fair
trade price for the engine if 10 per cent, for drawings and
patterns, and 20 per cent, for profit, are added to the cost
given above, thus bringing the amount to about &pound;400.</p>
<p>The working of the radiating gear of engine No. 2 proving so
satisfactory, I elaborated the principle so as to apply it to an
eight-wheeled locomotive. (No. 3 in the table.) In this case both
of the middle pairs of wheels have the traversing motion already
described, but, instead of the leading and trailing wheels being
radiated from one central pair, the second pair of wheels
radiates the leading pair, and the third pair of wheels the
trailing pair, thus forming a mechanism practically equal to a
double bogie. By this arrangement an eight-coupled engine is
obtained capable of passing round curves as severe as may be
necessary. In the present instance, the travel is constructed for
a minimum radius of 25 ft. The details of the engine are similar
to those of No. 2, but numerous improvements have been effected,
into all of which it would be tedious to enter. It may, however,
be mentioned that the ends of all the crank pins are boxed in by
the connecting and coupling rod brasses, to exclude dirt. A steam
water-lifter has also been added, by which the tanks can be
filled without delay during frost.</p>
<p>The blast-nozzle is made adjustable by raising or lowering an
internal cone. <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Owing to the steep gradient before alluded to, it was
impossible to get a fixed size of nozzle that would keep up steam
with a light load on the level, without being so contracted as to
lift the fire off the bars on the incline.</p>
<p>The boiler fittings have been made as symmetrical as possible,
and circular nuts have been substituted for hexagon, as more easy
to clean. The water-gauge glasses are put in through the top cock
and fastened by a single cap nut, thus doing away with the usual
external glands. The steam brake has a 5 in. cylinder, and the
rigging is arranged to swing with the traversing wheels.</p>
<p>The locomotive for the Eaton Railway (No. 4 in the table) was
built as an example of a four-wheeled engine for use where the
traffic was small and the gradient reasonable. With the exception
of radial axles, it is fitted up precisely as No. 8. It has not,
however, been altogether a success. From the data of its hauling
powers, it will readily be seen that there is no deficiency in
this respect; indeed, the maximum load handled exceeded all my
expectations. In its working, for now nearly two years, nothing
has gone amiss, nor has there been any trouble. On the contrary,
the engine has on all these points given full satisfaction. But
it is with regard to its effect on the road that I have my
doubts. The running is steady enough, and 20 miles an hour has
been attained without undue oscillation, yet nevertheless the
road suffers as it never suffers under the six and eight-wheeled
engines. The long and short of my experience is that I should not
again recommend a four-wheeler except for very short distances
and low speeds. Nothing but the experience I have had with this
engine could have impressed so forcibly on me the very distinct
advantages of such a radial action as I have adopted in my other
locomotives, which enables them to go round a considerably
sharper curve than the four-wheeler with an ease and absence of
grinding quite remarkable, to say nothing of the saving to the
road by the distribution of weight over more points. The relief
seems to be by no means so much in the lessening of the weight
per axle, which is not very great, as in the increased number of
points of support. I am well aware this is not a new discovery,
but it has come home to me with a practical force that leads me
to insist somewhat strongly upon its importance.</p>
<p>The whole of the foregoing locomotives have been entirely made
in my workshops, with the exception of the boilers and steel
castings. The former have been chiefly supplied to me of
excellent workmanship by Messrs. Abbott and Co., of Newark, and
the latter by the Hadfield Steel Foundry Co., of Sheffield.</p>
<p>The last locomotive in the table (No. 5) is now being
commenced, and will combine all the advantages of the previous
ones in a less costly engine than No. 8 which was built specially
with a view to see how powerful and fast travelling an engine
could be put on the 15 in. gauge. No. 5, with its smaller wheel,
is not <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>very inferior in hauling power to No. 8, and the expense
of the extra axle is saved. This is the engine that, if I had to
build another for the Eaton Railway, I should certainly recommend
in preference to the four-wheeled No. 4.</p>
<p>The wheels of such little locomotives, since speed is no
object, should be kept as small as possible, and the stroke
should be of the greatest length. The nearer the stroke can be
extended to half the diameter of the wheel, the more successful
will the engine prove on steep inclines. Good sand-boxes, front
and back, of ample capacity are essential, but it is not
advisable to fit any steam sanding apparatus, for, owing to the
low position of the motion, a good deal of the sand will rebound
into the joints and bearings, as I found by experiment.</p>
<p>Cabs on such small engines are to be avoided as unbearably hot
in summer, dangerous in case of emergency, and inconvenient at
all times on account of the contracted dimensions. A stout
mackintosh is cheaper and far better for the driver.</p>
<p>A steam water-lifter is a convenience in frosty weather when
the water supply above ground may be frozen up, but in summer the
engine tanks get so hot from their proximity to the boiler that
the water, which becomes lukewarm in the process of being raised
by the lifter, is then very soon at a temperature which makes the
action of the injectors precarious.</p>
<p>I may say that in all my locomotives I use Holden and
Brooke&rsquo;s restarting injector, which, after experiment with
many types, I find takes the hottest water and is in all ways
most reliable. I place brass wire strainers in both steam and
water-supply pipes close to the injector, which is invaribly
fixed below the tanks, so that when the injector is overheated
the water will run through by gravity and cool it; a most
important advantage.</p>

WAGONS AND CARS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wagons first put upon my line
measured only 4 ft. by 2 ft. inside. It soon became apparent,
however, that a gauge of 15 in. could carry with safety a much
larger vehicle. In fact it may be taken as a reasonable rule that
the floor area of narrow gauge wagons should not be less than
four times the gauge in length and twice the gauge in width. I
have found such a wagon very handy for light work, but on the
Eaton Railway I adopted an over measurement of 6 ft. by 3 ft.
with 1 ft. 3 in. depth of side. The wheel base is, in all cases,
half the length of the wagon. The larger wagon above described
carries 16 cwts. of coal, and from 20 to 22 cwts. of sand, road
metal, bricks, etc., and weighs about 7&frac12; cwts., or
one-fourth of its total gross loaded weight, <i>i.e.</i>, it
carries three times its own weight. The axles in this case are 2
in. diameter. For heavier loads I have made the wagons with
2&frac14; in. axles to carry 30 cwts. which is the standard I
have finally adopted; and also with 2&frac12; in. axles to carry
two tons. Two of these last were built for the Eaton line, on
which logs of timber up to 30 in. square and 60 ft. long have to
be conveyed from the G. W. Railway to the Estate works. Each end
of the log rests on a &ldquo;timber fork,&rdquo; which can be
fitted on to any wagon, and in this way, not only timber, but any
kind of lengthy goods can be carried with the greatest ease. My
resident engineer at Eaton gave me an amusing account of the
arrival from Messrs. Handyside &amp; Co. of the ironwork for the
coal store at Eaton. This included a number of long and awkward
shaped pieces, and the foreman sent by this firm to erect the
shed was in despair at seeing the toy wagons provided for the
transport of pieces that with some difficulty had been loaded in
the main line wagons. To his surprise the 15 in. gauge handled
them with far greater facility than the 4 ft. 8&frac12; in.,
owing to length being no drawback.</p>
<p>My standard wagons are constructed of pitch pine with
angle-iron rims, and the box sides are framed together
independently of the wagon itself, thus a flat wagon is converted
into a box wagon by merely placing this frame upon it. These
sides, or &ldquo;tops&rdquo; as they have come to be called, are
about 15 in. deep, and the wagons being constructed to a standard
size, are interchangeable. An iron rim on each enables two or
three of the tops to be placed one above another upon any wagon,
to give an extra depth. To empty the wagon, two men readily lift
off the top, and, if <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>necessary, turn it over sideways,
sufficiently to shoot off the contents; or the load may be upset
without removing the top. This mode is almost as rapid as
emptying a tip wagon, which, though convenient to unload, is a
fraud as to capacity, and cannot be designed to carry more than
one-and-a-half times its own weight; and even then there is the
objection that the centre of gravity is far higher than in the
box wagon.</p>
<p>For carrying timber or other lengthy loads swivelling carriers
can be placed on any two wagons; and if a greater length is
required, these two wagons can be set a distance apart, with or
without other wagons placed between them. By adopting the flat
wagon as a standard, it is possible to adapt each one to any
class of work, without the necessity of keeping a large variety
for various purposes. A narrow gauge is said not to lend itself
advantageously to the carrying of bulky material, but by loading
a train of wagons without break from end to end, I clear hay off
land, to which it happens that carts cannot have access, with
great despatch. There is, therefore, no valid objection on this
score. The cost of these wagons is from 80s. to 85s. per cwt. In
the two years the Eaton line has been at work they have proved
convenient in every way and show no signs as yet of wear.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of wagons, some of which are fitted
with brakes, there are on my line seven bogie passenger cars and
a bogie van; also a variety of miscellaneous stock, such as
workmen&rsquo;s car, screw and roller rail-benders, dynamometer
car, and various small trolleys. The dynamometer car is
constructed to indicate the tractive effort of the engine, the
speed, and the distance travelled. The roller rail bender is
worked by three men, two of whom work the winch which draws the
rail through the rollers, while the third adjusts the pressure to
produce the required curvature. The screw bender has two thrust
blocks, opposite which works a horizontal screw, which
straightens or bends rails with great accuracy, but in long or
sharp curves the roller bender is more rapid and efficient, as
elsewhere noted.</p>
<p>The passenger stock, which, like everything else, was built on
the premises, requires a somewhat more detailed notice. There are
four open cars, holding sixteen persons each, two abreast. These
are 19 ft. 6 in. long and 8 ft. 6 in. wide, and are carried on
two bogies of 1 ft. 6 in. wheel base, the total wheel base being
16 ft. 6 in. A foot brake is fitted to one bogie on each car. The
weight of these cars is 20 cwt.; they therefore only weigh
1&frac14; cwt. per passenger seat, and reckoning sixteen persons
to the ton, the proportion of live to dead weight is as 1 to 1.
On the main lines it is more than 1 to 5. The cost of these cars,
stained, varnished, and lined with linoleum, was &pound;37
each.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the capabilities of even so small a
gauge, a closed car of the same dimensions as those already
described was constructed, which has <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>doors and windows of the usual kind.
Lest it should be supposed that the space is unduly cramped, I
may mention that a visitor 6 ft. 3&frac12; in. in height, when
seated, found ample clearance for his tall hat. The cost of this
car was &pound;67, and the weight is 24 cwt. Here the proportion
of live to dead weight is as 5 to 6.</p>
<p>As a further test of the capacity of a 15 in. gauge, I have
built a dining car and a sleeping car of the same dimensions as
the cars already described. The former seats eight persons and
carries a suitable cooking stove in a compartment to itself. The
latter contains four berths 6 ft. 6 in. long and 1 ft. 10 in.
wide, with a lavatory and other fittings. This, though hardly an
essential accompaniment to a line under one mile in length, can
be utilised as an overflow bedroom for my boys when the house is
full of guests. I am unable to state the exact cost of these two
vehicles, but exclusive of fittings, it is little, if at all in
excess of that of the closed car already quoted. The weights are
somewhat greater, owing to the bogie truck frames being of cast
iron instead of elm.</p>
<p>A closed luggage van, 15 ft. in length, but otherwise of the
same pattern as the cars, concludes the list, and is used to
convey luncheons, teas, etc., for large parties, to the station
where refreshments are served. The extreme height of the closed
cars is 6 ft.</p>
<p>All the wagons and cars are carried on chilled iron wheels,
13&frac12; in. diameter, cast in my foundry. The axles, as has
been stated, vary from 2 in. to 2&frac12; in. in diameter, and on
to these the wheel on one side is forced by a hydraulic pressure
of about 15 tons, while the opposite wheel runs loose to reduce
the curve friction. The journals run in cast-iron boxes, which
are lubricated by sponges placed in oil receptacles below. The
horn-blocks and axle-boxes, with a rubber block between them to
form the spring, and a cover to the oil reservoir, are secured
together by a single bolt, after the insertion of which no part
can come loose. The castings are put together as they come from
the foundry, without machining or fitting of any kind, the axle
bedding well into the cast-iron box after a few days&rsquo; wear.
For the Eaton railway, however, I bored out the boxes, but have
not found any advantage to result. These bearings require oiling
only at intervals of several weeks, and although some of them
have been in use more than eighteen years, there has been no case
of heating or other failure. The cost of each complete bearing,
including horn-block box, cover, spring, and bolt, is only 5s.,
1s. of which goes for the rubber.</p>
<p>The buffers and couplings are central. A single east-iron
buffer, which in the case of the cars is mounted on a spring
draw-bar, has a coupler of the same metal hinged to it by a bolt.
The latter is self-coupling or not as desired; but, when turned
back so as not to couple, the driver can, by bringing the buffers
smartly <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>together, cause it to fall and couple up. These couplers
allow the wagons and cars to be shunted out of the train, when
the engine is either pushing or drawing, by a quick manipulation
of the points, the hook sliding laterally from its hold as the
vehicles diverge on different lines. I designed some cast-steel
coupler-buffers of this type lately for the Royal
Engineers&rsquo; 30 in. gauge experimental field railway, near
Chatham, which, though for reasons unconnected with their
construction not adopted, are reported as the only ones of
several types experimented with &lsquo;which fulfilled the
necessary requirements. In the bogie stock the coupler-buffers
are fitted to the bogie, and not to the car frame, on account of
the severe curves. In the construction of the wagons and cars
almost every part is made to gauge, and put together without
fitting.</p>
<p>The aim throughout has been to make the details of all the
rolling-stock as simple, cheap, and efficient as possible, which
has been principally achieved by adopting designs and modes of
construction largely at variance with commonly accepted notions.
The totally different conditions under which minimum-gauge lines
work, as compared with ordinary railways, renders this possible
without any sacrifice of safety or durability.</p>
<p>In Section IV. mention was made of tip-wagons supplied as an
experiment to the Eaton line. These consist of steel tubs, U
shaped in section, hung at each end on two trunnions riding in
cast-iron pedestals, the latter being bolted to an under-frame of
channel steel fitted with cast iron ends rivetted in, and so
formed as to carry a drawbar with rubber cushions, to the end of
which the coupler-buffer is attached. These wagons cost &pound;20
as against &pound;12 for the standard box wagon. They weigh
11&frac12; cwts., and carry about this weight of coal, or a
little more. Loaded with coal, they average a trifle under 24
cwt., exactly the same as the box wagon, which weighs 7&frac12;
cwt., and carries 16 to 17 cwt. of coal. Thus the paying loads of
the two are as 3 to 4 for the same hauled weight. For short
distances, where the emptying bears a greater proportional
relation to the running time, or where the load must be got rid
of in a particularly short space of time, tip-wagons may answer.
For such purposes as my experience has had to deal with, they are
a drawback, which, as I have previously pointed out, is increased
by their inadaptability to the carriage of bulky goods. One of my
strong contentions is that, on a small line, to avoid expense in
rolling stock, every vehicle should be available for every
purpose.</p>

THE DUFFIELD BANK WORKSHOPS.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">brief</span> account of my little works
will be of some interest to engineers. I have already, in Section

ordinary purposes and also for the treatment of angle iron,
&amp;c.; a 2&frac12; cwt. gas hammer; a punching and shearing
machine; a bench vice, and complete set of smiths&rsquo;
tools.</p>
<p>The erecting shop contains an overhead travelling crane; an
engine pit; a 30-ton hydraulic press for putting axles into
wheels, crank pins into cranks, testing samples, &amp;c.; a hand
screwing and tapping machine to &frac34; in. for bolts and to 1
in. for pipes; standards for fitting up frame-plates; a rivet
heating forge; two bench vices, and tools for tube extracting and
other special processes connected with the construction and
repair of locomotives.</p>
<p>The iron-foundry contains a 16 in. cupola worked through a
double tuy&egrave;re by a &ldquo;Root&rsquo;s&rdquo; blower; an
overhead travelling crane; a core stove; charge-weighing scales;
a large supply of boxes for general purposes, and special ones
for cylinders, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>chilled-wheels, sleepers, gutters, &amp;c., with all
ladles and other appliances suitable for producing castings up to
half-a-ton weight. Especial pains have been taken to turn out
chilled wheels (13&frac12; in. diameter), for the rolling stock,
of perfect smoothness and of even depth of chill.</p>
<p>The brass foundry contains a furnace, a metal moulding bench,
and the usual fittings.</p>
<p>The carriage shop has two lines of 15 in. gauge formed of cast
plates bolted together and bedded in concrete, and contains a
wood-morticing and boring machine; fitters and joiners&rsquo;
vices, with every convenience for erecting, finishing, and
painting two of the long 20 ft. bogie cars simultaneously, or
eight of the standard wagons, according to requirements; all
bulky joiners&rsquo; and carpenters&rsquo; work is also done in
this shop.</p>
<p>The pattern and joiners&rsquo; shop contains a 5 in.
Holtzappfel lathe; and a small circular saw; 2 instantaneous-grip

pump.</p>
<p>The drawing office is fitted up with the usual appliances, and
is in telephonic communication with my house and two of the
stations on the railway.</p>
<p>The general stores comprise timber; foundry sand of various
qualities; five kinds of pig iron; copper, spelter, tin, &amp;c.;
bar, rod, and angle iron; wrought-iron tubing up to 2 in.; bolts,
rivets, nuts, and pins; steam fittings of all kinds; every sort
of requisite needed in the construction of small railways and
rolling stock, and also for meeting house and farm
requirements.</p>
<p>The pattern store contains patterns for all the locomotive,
carriage, wagon, signal, permanent way, and general experimental
work; and for drain grates, gutters, &amp;c. which are supplied
from Duffield for my other estates.</p>
<p>The shops are lit by gas, and the 15 in. gauge line runs
throughout. The construction, both in wood and iron, is done as
far as possible to template, and every endeavour is made to turn
out the very best work, which is perhaps the more easily attained
in that there are no profits to be considered. At the same time
it should be explained that the shops and machinery are,
throughout, though good and sufficient for their purpose, in no
way models of excellence. Their object is only to turn out the
chiefly experimental work required, and the gradual additions
that have been made during the twenty-five years of their
existence have been done as cheaply as was consistent with
efficiency.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Outside
the shops are a weigh-bridge for weighing rolling-stock and
loads, and a six-ton crane to tranship heavy goods from drays to
the 15 in. railway.</p>
<p>Adjoining the workshops is the locomotive shed, with rails
raised 30 in. above the floor, so as to get more easily at the
lower parts of these small engines. It is arranged for two
locomotives, and is fitted with an air jet for raising steam, and
with a water supply.</p>
<p>The carriage and wagon stock is, for the most part, housed in
three sheds at various stations on the main part of the railway,
80 ft. above the workshops.</p>

SCIENTIFIC CONSIDERATIONS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present section contains the
result of experiments and experience on points which, for the
most part, are of interest only to those who study the scientific
side of railway work. I here take the opportunity of placing on
record various considerations, more or less connected with the
subject of narrow-gauge railways, of too technical a nature to be
mixed up with the descriptive pages. This explanation will
account for the somewhat disjointed nature of the statements
which follow.</p>
<p>The fact that narrow gauge locomotives are usually required to
surmount much steeper gradients than are generally to be found on
standard railways, makes adhesion a question of the first
importance. It is very generally supposed that the co-efficient
of adhesion between a wheel and a rail is a constant fraction of
the insistent weight, varying slightly with the molecular
structure of the metals in contact. There is, however, reason to
believe that it decreases considerably with an increase of
weight. In locomotives of the standard gauge, with from 12 to 18
tons per driven axle, it is generally held that a co-efficient of
adhesion of one-sixth is all that can be counted on with
certainty. From a number of experiments on the Festiniog Railway,
with the results of which the late Mr. Spooner, who himself
supported the theory, was good enough to supply me, I found that
the load there per driven axle was five tons, the co-efficient
averaging about one-fifth. Again, with my small engines that have
a load on each axle of from 1.2 to 1.6 tons, the calculated
co-efficient is two-ninths, in support of which I give the
following experiment, conducted in the <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>presence of two gentlemen belonging
to a firm of locomotive builders, when it was under consideration
to build for military purposes some engines on the plan of the
No. 2 described in Section V.</p>
<p>I guaranteed that the locomotive referred to should take a
load equal to its own weight up a gradient of 1 in 10 a quarter
of a mile long, which then was, in parts, as steep as 1 in 9,
with a short curve of half-a-chain radius at the severest part.
This was satisfactorily accomplished. The day being dry, I was
requested to ascertain what was the maximum load that could be
hauled. On reaching four tons, when the start had to be made on a
less gradient, the engine barely struggled up, and this was
evidently all it could do. When full up with coal and water it
weighed at that time 3 tons 6 cwt. During the experiment,
however, there were but 3 tons 2 cwt. on the three axles, all of
which were coupled. The boiler pressure was 145 lbs. exactly,
and, the gross weight of engine and train being 7 tons 2 cwt.,
the gravity resistance on the gradient of 1 in 10 was equal to
14.2 cwt. The weight of 3 tons 2 cwt. available for adhesion,
reduced by a tenth part, which the gradient converts into gravity
resistance, was equal to 56 cwt. Thus, without reckoning the
curve friction of the whole train and the journal friction of the
wagons, both uncertain quantities, the proportion of developed
tractive power to load was as 1 to 3.9. This result confirms the
probability of the truth of the above assertion. Assuming its
correctness, which appears beyond doubt, what is the explanation
of increased proportionate adhesion with a decreased weight on
the driven axles?&nbsp; The reduced diameter of wheel in the
smaller engines might seem to offer a solution of the problem.
Experience, however, goes to prove that, if there is any
difference, a larger wheel has, with equal insistent weights, a
better grip of the rail than a small one. I am of opinion that
the weight is directly responsible for the difference. A wheel
rests upon a rail on one point, or possibly on a transverse line
of which the length is equal to the width of the rail. With a
small insistent weight the molecules of the wheel and rail
interlock without injury, and adhesion, on the principle of an
infinitesimal rack and pinion, is the result. As the weight is
increased on the fine bearing area, the molecules become
disturbed, and fail to offer so firm a fulcrum. Ultimately they
become displaced, and move as rollers between the two surfaces,
materially reducing the adhesion. If this theory be the correct
one, as is not improbable, the graduated reduction in the
adhesion would be accounted for.</p>
<p>That the rolling wheel and rail do actually interlock was
demonstrated by Sir Douglas Galton in his experiments on the
retarding power of brakes, when he pointed out that, on a wheel
becoming skidded, the rack and pinion motion was converted into a
series of jumps of the wheel across the microscopic teeth of the
rack, with <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>a consequent reduction in adhesion proportionate to the
sliding speed. In confirmation of this statement I detailed,
during the meeting of the British Association at Sheffield, an
experiment I made by reversing a locomotive so as to skid the
wheels, and ultimately to cause them to revolve in a contrary
direction, while descending an incline. With skidded wheels the
descent was at a certain speed with backward revolution of the
wheels the speed increased rapidly, the effect of the reversal
being to cause the wheel to slip over the rail at a speed greater
than that at which the engine was moving, thus showing that Sir
Douglas Galton&rsquo;s theory of the adhesion diminishing in
proportion to the extent of departure from the interlocking or
rolling motion of the wheel on the rail remained consistent even
beyond sliding contact, and disposing of the old theory that the
loss of adhesion with a skidded wheel was due to the creation of
a polished point of contact on the wheel.</p>
<p>Another somewhat curious point in connection with adhesion is
the slip of the driving wheels, which is naturally in the
direction of causing a greater number of revolutions of the
wheels than would be due to the length of rail travelled over.
Occasionally, however, I have, in experimenting, noticed that
fewer revolutions are made than would suffice to travel the
distance as measured on a centre line between the rails. That is,
the wheels slipped forward instead of back. This freak is
probably due to the outer wheel on a curve slipping forward when,
owing to considerable superelevation and a low speed, the inner
wheel is the more heavily weighted, the distance then travelled
being the reduced length of the inner rail.</p>
<p>I now proceed to explain the basis of calculation of the net
loads hauled on various gradients, as appended to particulars of
each locomotive described in Section V. The resistance on the
level consists of journal friction, tire friction, and locomotive
internal friction. Tire friction is practically nil, except on
curves and in strong side winds. Journal friction I find, in the
case of my small rolling stock, to be covered by an allowance of
10 lbs. per ton. Owing to the numerous curves another 10 lbs. per
ton must be added to cover tire friction. A tractive power of 20
lbs. per ton proves quite sufficient to keep the train in motion
on the level. It is not, however, enough to start the train on a
curve, nor to overcome the inertia due to journal friction when,
as on an incline, there is no slack between the wagons, and the
whole train must be started at once. After considerable
experience I find it necessary to add a further 20 lbs. per ton
to the required tractive power. A total of 40 lbs. per ton is
thus allowed as a good working equivalent of the frictional
resistance of the train.</p>
<p>The friction of the locomotive is a much more complicated
question. There <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>seems very little information available on this point.
It has been said, in the case of full sized engines, to absorb
thirty per cent. of the tractive power, but this is a vague
estimate, out of all reason excessive, unless it be intended to
include gravity resistance on a steep incline. It is desirable to
consider the nature of the various causes of resistance to motion
separately. Viewed as a carriage only, the journal and tire
friction of the locomotive may be taken at the same amount per
ton of its weight as in the case of the trains, namely, 40 lbs.
The additional resistance due to friction of the moving parts of
the mechanism cannot be calculated as a constant. If the engine
is developing but a small portion of its power, the amount will
be small; when loaded to its full capacity there will be a large
increase of internal resistance, varying, however, in proportion
to the accuracy with which it is put together, and the stiffness
of the framing.</p>
<p>Such experiments as I have made show clearly that, when
exerting approximately its full power, the total frictional
resistance of the engine does not exceed 100 lbs. per ton, and
when running light is much less, but in what proportion less I
have as yet failed to ascertain satisfactorily. Of this 100 lbs.
per ton, from 20 to 40 lbs. is due to journal and tire friction,
leaving from 60 lbs. to 80 lbs. per ton as the deduction for
internal friction.</p>
<p>I thus conclude that an allowance of 40 lbs. per ton for train
resistance, and 100 lbs. per ton for engine resistance, is a
basis for calculating the tractive power required on the level
that is sufficient under all possible narrow-gauge conditions. In
the case of gradients there must, of course, be added the gravity
resistance of the engine and train, which is, on a gradient of 1
in 100, one-100th of the gross weight; on a gradient of 1 in 50,
one-50th, and so on.</p>
<p>In calculating the tractive power of the engine, the effective
pressure in the cylinders may be reckoned at fully nine-tenths of
the boiler pressure, on account of the low piston speed.</p>
<p>The above particulars are not to be taken as representative of
what can be got out of a narrow-gauge engine in a few isolated
experiments only, but of what is well within the compass of daily
work.</p>

REMARKS ON NARROW GAUGE RAILWAYS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> to this point I have merely
detailed the particulars of the construction of my experimental
railway and of the line at Eaton, giving at the same time the
reasons that have led me to adopt certain methods and designs. I
now propose, in conclusion, to offer a few remarks upon the
application, in this country and abroad, of small railways of 2
ft. gauge and under to do work at present done by means of horses
and carts.</p>
<p>The cases in which such lines can be profitably applied may be
classed under two heads; the one, where, in a country possessing
ports or a system of railways, large establishments, private,
public, or industrial, might be connected therewith by a narrow
gauge line so as to reduce the cost of transport below that which
has to be paid for haulage by animal power on roads; the other,
when no roads worthy of the name are available, and the choice is
a light railway or nothing. The chief condition of success in
both cases is a sufficient traffic between two or more definite
points. Military railways, however, must be regarded from a
somewhat different standpoint, as the object here is to supply a
movable centre as expeditiously as possible with the vast
commissariat requirements of an army rather than to study
economy. It is not my intention to enter into the pros and cons
of small railways for war purposes. Suffice it to say that some
countries are ahead of us in the matter, which is one that has,
in England, been allowed to drop rather into the background.</p>
<p>Returning to the consideration of cases where a fairly large
traffic has to be delivered to a port or railway system, the
first question that arises is that of transhipment. Material of
any kind can be as effectively delivered on ship-board by narrow
gauge railway wagons as by horses and carts, if not better. In
reckoning up the cost of transhipment from small wagons on to a
railway system&mdash;no great matter with proper
appliances&mdash;it must not be lost sight of that, even if a
branch of standard gauge were constructed to many establishments,
the large wagons cannot, as a rule, be got up to the point where
the material lies, and a preliminary transference in barrows or
carts is necessary. With the little wagons it is usually possible
to get right up to the place and to load direct, in which case
there is clearly no additional expense incurred. It is, further,
often forgotten <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>that there is on the standard railways endless
transhipment for the sake of economical transport, in no way
connected with a break of gauge.</p>
<p>Again, a small line can be carried round curves, up gradients,
and through confined premises, where a wider line would be
inadmissible. In many places the unsightliness of the standard
gauge would be objected to, nor can such a line be made very
light if it has to carry, as it must, the 7 or 8 tons per axle of
a full sized coal wagon (see Appendix A).</p>
<p>The narrow gauge has also the advantage in first cost, and by
bringing the small wagons on to a level with the floors of the
large ones, or, in the case of minerals, by erecting a simple
shoot, the transhipment difficulty may be reduced to a
minimum.</p>
<p>It is not well to have gradients steeper than 1 in 40 where
avoidable, as difficulty will be experienced in slippery weather;
but it is quite possible with suitable engines to work inclines
of moderate length, as steep as 1 in 12. The diminution of the
power of the locomotive on gradients is also a matter for
consideration, the importance of which will be clear when it is
stated that if an engine will haul, as it should, in addition to
itself, ten times its own weight on the level, it will haul,
speaking roughly, only four times its weight up 1 in 50, twice
its weight up 1 in 25, and once its weight up 1 in 12. More work
can be done if adhesion does not fail, but the above is an
approximate working average.</p>
<p>The speed on small lines is not generally a matter of much
moment, owing to their usually moderate length. A locomotive that
is sufficiently powerful to start a given load, will without
difficulty get it along at from 8 to 10 miles an hour. It has
occurred to me that a very fair approximation to the reasonable
running speed of which any gauge is capable is to be found in
estimating that the speed of passenger trains is equal to as many
miles per hour as the gauge is inches wide, and, for goods
trains, to half that amount.</p>
<p>The permanent way should be made a thoroughly sound job, as it
will then cost but little for repairs. Particulars of what is
recommended will be found in Sections III. and IV. I am no
advocate of portable railways, which may be well enough for hand
trains, or even for horse traction, but a locomotive requires a
solid and clean road if it is to work to advantage.</p>
<p>It is often possible to carry a narrow gauge railway by the
roadside or, as at Eaton, over pasture lands without the
necessity of fencing the line in. Fences can be crossed as
described in Sections III. and IV., so long as arable land is
avoided. Where the route is not wholly the property of the
projector of the railway, the requisite way-leave may frequently
be leased by paying an annual acknowledgment of from 3d. to 6d.
per yard run.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>It now
remains to show what traffic is required in order that a line of
this description may repay the outlay upon it. This may best be
effected by drawing a comparison between the cost of locomotive
traction on rails and horse traction on roads. The cost of
loading and unloading will not be included, as these are the same
in both cases. (See also Section IV.)</p>
<p>Taking the minimum distance apart of two points, between which
haulage may be supposed to be required, as one mile, the smallest
and cheapest gauge as 15 in., and allowing 2,000 yds. to the mile
so as to include the necessary sidings, the cost of the line will
be as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>
<p>If laid with pitch pine sleepers a reduction of about
&pound;100 per mile would be effected, the cost of renewal being
correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>The engine would be capable of hauling a gross load, exclusive
of its own weight, of 12 tons up a gradient of 1 in 50, which may
be taken as a fair ruling gradient for a surface line. This would
be equal to an average paying load of about 8 tons; so that,
supposing the engine to make one trip per hour, about 60 tons
would be moved per day; although, with a double set of wagons and
men, 100 tons would easily be handled.</p>
<p>If the engine worked two days a week, or say 100 days per
annum, it would have hauled 6,000 tons one mile in the year. A
less load hauled on the return journeys need not be taken into
account, as this would make no difference in the comparison, such
work being practically done without extra cost in both cases.</p>
<p>The cost of the line per annum would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>This is
equal to about 11d. per ton. Now the same haulage by horses and
carts in Great Britain would usually cost about 1s. 3d. per ton,
and in this case there is the advantage of being able to haul, if
necessary, in other directions if required, which would somewhat
reduce the financial advantage of the railway, but still leave it
a distinct superiority.</p>
<p>It is probable that a traffic of 5,000 tons annually over a
mile of line is the smallest amount that would repay the
construction of a narrow gauge railway, for the estimate has been
based upon the narrowest line which can profitably be employed.
If the line were longer, the balance in its favour would be
greater. This would also be the case if the traffic were greater,
and with the maximum amount which the line, using only one, but a
larger engine, could accommodate, say 40,000 tons, the concern
would be very profitable, for the extra charge for renewals would
not be heavy, and the cost per ton carried would be reduced to
about 5d. or 6d.</p>
<p>No allowance has been made for way leaves or purchase of land.
Should there be outlay under these heads, the cost of transport
would be increased accordingly.</p>
<p>In concluding these comparisons, in which it may be thought
that the railway is shown in a less attractive light than might
have been expected from an enthusiast, I may explain that I am no
advocate of ill considered schemes, planned without proper
knowledge, cheaply constructed, and carelessly worked. My figures
represent thoroughly sound and serviceable plant, kept in good
repair. If it is not worth while to go to such expense, then it
is not worth while to construct a railway at all. I have been
fortunate enough to work my line for twenty years without the
slightest injury to a single person of the many thousands that
have been carried as invited guests for pleasure, as visitors
interested in my experiments, or as workmen on the premises. None
of the rolling stock has sustained more than the most trivial
damage; and derailments, beyond an occasional mishap in shunting,
are unknown. The working of the Eaton line has been equally
satisfactory. This immunity from accident I attribute entirely to
proper care having been taken to construct every part, not only
of the best materials and workmanship, but also with a careful
eye to the fitness of each detail for the purpose it has to
serve.</p>
<p>That there are many openings for lines of 2 ft. gauge and
under, is beyond dispute. But while, already, this mode of
transport is largely made use of abroad and in our colonies, a
deeply rooted prejudice has hitherto prevented it from gaining a
footing in England and Scotland.</p>
<p>Admirable articles pointing out the advantages of light
railways have appeared from time to time in the daily press with
little or no effect. It is one of the <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>strangest anomalies in the progress
of civilisation in this country that Great Britain almost wholly
refused till lately to countenance such lines. The reasons for
this obstinacy are not readily discoverable. Probably the innate
conservatism of every Englishman&mdash;for there exists here no
such thing as liberalism out of the region of politics&mdash;has
been the principal factor in determining this course of
inaction.</p>
<p>Even now that the Light Railway Act has passed, there is
little or no movement in the direction of making small lines such
as I refer to, and not much in respect of larger ones. Whether,
in the future, private individuals will, in their own interest
and in that of their neighbours and dependents, lay out money in
this way, it is impossible to foresee. But undoubtedly there are
many openings for such installations, particularly on large
estates, where the possession of the land gives the owner a free
hand.</p>

APPENDIX</h2>
<h3>A</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following letter, which
appeared in <i>The Times</i> two years ago, is here reprinted as
bearing on various points connected with narrow-gauge railways.
Special attention is directed to what is advanced under the third
head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>LIGHT RAILWAYS.</b><br />
<i>TO THE EDITOR OF</i> &ldquo;<i>THE TIMES</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;The movement in favour of secondary railways has
evoked from your numerous correspondents widely divergent views.
This want of accord is more apparent than real, and it would
facilitate the proceedings of the approaching conference <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a> if conflicting opinions could be
partially reconciled beforehand.</p>
<p>The causes to which these differences are due may be
summarized under three heads:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The absence of a defined terminology of the distinctive
kinds of railways.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>2. The
failure to appreciate that a scheme which is good for one
locality is not of necessity the best for all.</p>
<p>3. The apparently meagre acquaintance on the part of those who
state their views with the practical working of any but the
standard railways of the country.</p>
<p>Under the first head, some confusion has arisen in consequence
of the application of the term &ldquo;light railway&rdquo; now to
lines of the standard gauge only, and again to narrow-gauge lines
also. Similarly with other expressions. It may be pointed out
that the term &ldquo;light railway&rdquo; is properly applicable
and should be confined to a line of standard gauge, of which the
entire construction is lighter, cheaper, and simpler than is
obligatory where weighty engines, heavy traffic, and high speeds
are dealt with. Any line of less than the standard, gauge is
correctly described as a &ldquo;narrow-gauge railway,&rdquo; and
such lines, when not of a permanent character, come under the
title, simply, of &ldquo;portable railways,&rdquo; for these are
invaribly of less than the normal width. The term
&ldquo;tramway&rdquo; should be restricted to its modern meaning
of a line laid in the metalled or paved surface of a road or
street. Finally, the not unfamiliar appellation of
&ldquo;secondary railways&rdquo; might be fitly adopted as
generally descriptive of all lines not amenable to the standard
railway regulations of the Board of Trade. It would be well that
the conference should pronounce on these points.</p>
<p>In regard to the second head, needless controversy is
engendered by attempting to assume that, because a light railway
is right here, therefore a narrow-gauge railway is wrong there,
or vice versa. In estimating the transport requirements of any
particular locality, if connection is to be made with the railway
system, the applicability of a light railway, as above defined,
should first be considered. By its adoption the use of existing
rolling-stock is secured, transhipment is avoided, and the line
can be subsequently and without difficulty transformed, if
necessary, into a railway of standard
construction&mdash;advantages for which much may be sacrificed.
But as it would be almost invariably essential to build a light
railway of sufficient strength to carry the 15 tons gross weight
of a standard coal wagon, the permanent way would be of a
somewhat costly character, and, in the case of severe gradients,
considerable difficulty would arise in providing suitable
locomotive power.</p>
<p>Where the impediments in the way of a light railway branch are
insuperable, or where the proposed line has no connexion with the
railway system, the advantages of a narrow-gauge railway may
properly be weighed&mdash;such as the smaller width occupied, the
sharper curves admissible, the lighter, cheaper, and more
easily-handled permanent way and rolling-stock, the absence of
much of the unsightliness of a line of standard gauge, the ease
with which, in the ease of gauges under 2 ft., the rails can be
laid among and into existing buildings, and, lastly, the
convenience of being <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>able to load and unload small wagons
at the exact point required without the intervention of carts or
barrows.</p>
<p>In regard to the third head, it may be noticed as a curious
fact, that the strong and commendable predilections of English
engineers for the standard gauge, whenever obtainable, appear to
lead them, where circumstances compel the adoption of a narrower
one, to advocate as little reduction as possible. Now, the
general result of foreign experience goes strongly to show that
narrow gauges exceeding 30 in. approximate so closely to a
full-size line as to forfeit, to a considerable extent, the
advantages of either system. This attitude is probably due to
ignorance of what can be done on the narrowest gauges, for, in
spite of the fact that many hundreds of miles of lines of less
than 2 ft. gauge are at work abroad, our professional advisers
persist in regarding such railways as mere toys. Yet a line of 15
in. gauge has been at work in this country for twenty years, on
which thousands of passengers have been carried without a single
accident, as many as 120 in one train, over gradients as steep as
1 in 20, the goods traffic being worked in all weathers up a long
gradient of 1 in 11 without difficulty. <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a></p>
<p>It would be well that our railway engineers should inform
themselves more fully on the subject, as otherwise their valuable
assistance, which would insure that narrow-gauge railways were
constructed in a solid and reliable manner, will be thrust on one
side by the requirements of the times, and the work will be
wholly in the hands of the many manufacturers of narrow-gauge
plant, whose designs, being chiefly of what is known as the
portable class, are, for the most part, ill adapted for permanent
locomotive traffic. If so, it is likely that, in the push that
may very possibly be presently made for secondary railways, the
results will not be so satisfactory as would be the case if the
work were carried out under the direction of professional
advisers.</p>
<p>Under the same head, attention may be directed to the fact
that it is entirely unnecessary to urge the adoption of a
standard narrow gauge. The circumstances of each case will decide
the most suitable gauge, and it is only where there is a
possibility, as in the North Wales district, of a wide
ramification of connected narrow-gauge lines that the adoption of
a particular standard is of any importance.</p>

49</span>B.</h3>
<p>The annexed letter, published in The Times about two years
ago, deals with possible difficulties to be met with by those who
make a private line of railway. I brought to bear all the
influence I could to obtain the insertion of a clause in the Act
which would meet the &ldquo;public road crossing&rdquo;
difficulty, but without success. The course which I took in the
case of the Eaton Railway here detailed may be of service.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>PRIVATE LIGHT RAILWAYS</b>.<br
/>
<i>TO THE EDITOR OF</i> &ldquo;<i>THE TIMES</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;May I, through your columns, draw attention to a
class of light railway which does not apparently come within the
purview of the Bill now before Parliament&mdash;that of lines
constructed by private individuals or firms for their own
purposes? These will usually confer advantage upon the district
in which they may be situate by relieving the roads of a more or
less heavy traffic, and in some cases by offering facilities of
transport to a section of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In a proposed route two difficulties may arise. In the first
place, land not in possession of the projector may have to be
invaded, and way-leaves obtained by a judicious tact in selecting
the ground and in approaching the owners, since private interest
is properly debarred from invoking compulsory powers. This
problem, then, may frequently be satisfactorily solved. The
second and more common impediment is the crossing or skirting of
highways, and it is to this point that my letter is specially
directed. The county and district councils are usually ready in
their own interest to permit a private line to cross a road on
the level&mdash;an over or under bridge is almost invariably
impossible by reason of the expense&mdash;or to make use for a
short distance of waste space by the road side. But&mdash;and
here is the crux&mdash;no permanent agreement is obtainable,
because councils have apparently no power to bind their
successors in office, and without such guarantee the projector is
naturally unwilling to risk his capital when the possible
rescinding of the concession would render his entire outlay
abortive.</p>
<p>The Light Railway Bill contains, apparently, no provision
under which this disability can be remedied, for it is improbable
that the Commissioners would take action in respect of a private
concern. The above difficulty was lately met with in the
construction of a private narrow-gauge line for the Duke of
Westminster, which crosses a main road. The matter was ultimately
compromised by the insertion of a clause in the agreement to the
effect that, should the county council give notice to discontinue
the crossing, the Duke should be entitled to appeal to the Board
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of Trade
for arbitration. There is, however, no assurance that the Board
would consent to appoint an arbitrator if called upon, but it is
very certain that if a provision legalizing such an appeal could
be incorporated in the Bill a serious hardship would be thereby
removed, and some encouragement given to private persons to
embark capital in enterprises of the kind.</p>
<p>As a case in point, and doubtless there are plenty of others,
a quarry owner of my acquaintance is at the present time
conveying some 80,000 tons of stone annually by means of
traction-engines from his works to the railway along 2&frac12;
miles of highway. The road authorities, levying &pound;400 a year
for extraordinary traffic, are utterly incapable of coping with
the destructive action of the heavy loads, and the roads are in a
state of disintegration that baffles description. The proprietor
of the quarry would at once set about making a narrow-gauge line
at his own expense, with the cordial good-will of the county and
district councils and his neighbours generally, could he only
obtain some guarantee that the permission to cross and, in some
parts, run alongside the road, which to-day would be gratefully
accorded, would not be suddenly revoked at a future date.</p>
<p>Perhaps those in charge of the Bill will see their way to give
this point their consideration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, Sir, your obedient
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">ARTHUR PERCIVAL HEYWOOD.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">FROM A MANCHESTER PAPER.</p>
<p>According to a correspondent in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Times</i>
projectors of private light railways have hitherto been very
chary of risking their capital owing to the precarious nature of
their running powers. In nine cases out of ten the light railway
proposes to cross or skirt the highways at certain points, and
the permission which may be given by one district council in such
cases is revocable by the next. This must be so inevitably, for
circumstances might well arise under which a level crossing, for
instance, would become a public danger. The difficulty might well
be met by an appeal to arbitration in all cases of proposed
revocation of the running powers; and if the Board of Trade were
to undertake to nominate the arbitrator, the projector ought to
have no reasonable ground for timidity. The present Bill can only
be regarded as proposing to set an example and provide occasional
assistance to the construction of light railways. Seeing,
therefore, that its chief result, if successful, will be to
encourage a more extensive construction of railways, it is
important that all obstacles in the way of private enterprise in
this direction should be at once removed. The <i>Times</i>
correspondent suggests that the insertion of a clause providing
for arbitration in all cases of dispute with the highway
authorities would meet the difficulty.</p>

<p>The regulations given below, which I drew up for use on the
Eaton line, and which have worked very well for two years, may,
to some, be of interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>EATON RAILWAY</b>.</p>
<h4>GENERAL REGULATIONS.</h4>
<p>1. All persons connected with the Railway shall be held
responsible for making themselves acquainted with such of the
regulations as apply to them, and for acting in accordance
therewith.</p>
<p>2. All workmen on the Estate shall be liable to such fines for
infraction of the Railway Regulations as are herein set forth,
and as the Estate Office may see fit further to order.</p>
<p>3. All men employed on the Railway Staff shall promptly report
any infraction of the Regulations which may come under their
notice, or they shall be themselves liable to any penalty which
may attach to such offence.</p>
<p>4. All workmen on the Estate are particularly requested to
remove any impediment, such as sticks or stones, which they may
see on the line; and in case of any serious block, such as a tree
fallen across the rails, to give prompt notice to one of the
Railway Staff.</p>
<p>5. No wagon or car shall (under a penalty of 1s.) be moved by
hand on to or along the main line, except by special arrangement
with the engine-driver; and the term &ldquo;main line&rdquo;
shall be understood to include every part of the railway not
being a siding or within a terminal yard.</p>
<p>6. Hand shunting of vehicles on sidings shall be done
carefully, so as to avoid injury to the rolling stock; but no
vehicle shall be moved at all except by an authorised person.</p>
<p>7. No vehicle shall (under a penalty of 1s.) be left in such a
position on a siding as to interfere with the free passage of
other vehicles along adjoining rails.</p>
<p>8. If it is necessary to throw over time weight of any
point-lever, this shall be done gently, and the weight shall
always be returned as soon as possible to the position in which
the white bar thereon is uppermost. Point levers of which the
weights are pinned in one direction, shall not (under a penalty
of 1s.) have the locking pins tampered with.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>9. No
material of any kind whatever shall (under a penalty of 1s.) be
deposited within a distance of two feet from the rail on any part
of the main line or sidings.</p>
<p>10. No heavy weight shall be dropped upon the rails or
sleepers, and no carts shall cross any part of the line except
where a proper crossing of double rails is provided. But in the
terminal yards light loads may cross the rails where the ballast
is for that purpose made level with the top of the metals. Any
unintentional damage to rolling stock or the line shall be at
once reported to the engine-driver or foreman platelayer.</p>
<p>11. No unauthorised person shall ride on any part of the
train, and those having permission shall, whenever possible,
travel in vehicles provided with seats.</p>
<p>12. It is desired that all workmen on the Estate should
understand that there exists the same liability to accident on a
narrow-gauge line as on one of full size, and that it is only by
a similar careful observance of proper regulations that serious
mishaps will be avoided.</p>
<h4>REGULATIONS FOR YARDMEN.</h4>
<p>13. Yardmen shall carefully observe the General Regulations
for the safe conduct of traffic comprised in Rules 1 to 12
inclusive.</p>
<p>14. The yardman at each terminus shall clean and oil all
points in or near his yard at least once a week, and keep them
perfectly free from grit, leaves, etc.</p>
<p>15. In frost or snow the points shall receive daily attention,
and great care shall be taken in releasing frozen switches not to
strain them. Salt for this purpose, shall, on account of its
injurious effect on the rails, be used only as a last
resource.</p>
<p>16. Yardmen shall take care that the loads on wagons are
securely placed, evenly balanced, and not in excess of the
specified weight.</p>
<p>17. Lengthy articles shall be loaded on a sufficient number of
wagons to ensure that the ends thereof do not catch against other
wagons.</p>
<p>18. All vehicles shall be loaded to the satisfaction of the
engine-driver.</p>
<p>19. Yardmen shall give the earliest possible intimation to the
engine-driver of the nature and quantity of the material
requiring transport from their respective yards, that he may
provide the necessary wagons at the proper time.</p>
<p>20. Yardmen shall take care that the wagons and cars are not
roughly handled, and shall see that heavy lumps of coal or other
material are not thrown carelessly on to the wagon bottoms.</p>
<p>21. The yardman at Balderton shall be responsible for the
washing of all wagons when necessary, and the yardman at Eaton
shall similarly see to all the bogie cars. Care shall be taken in
washing that no water is allowed to run into the axle boxes.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>22.
Yardmen shall use their best endeavours to get the rolling stock
in their respective yards promptly unloaded, and also put under
cover at night and in wet weather.</p>
<h4>REGULATIONS FOR PLATELAYERS.</h4>
<p>23. Platelayers shall carefully observe the General
Regulations for the safe conduct of traffic comprised in Rules 1
to 12 inclusive.</p>
<p>24. The foreman platelayer shall be responsible for keeping
the whole of the permanent way, bridges, cattle stops, banks,
road crossings, etc., in proper repair.</p>
<p>25. He shall see that every set of points on the line is kept
in good working order, but he shall only be responsible for the
oiling and cleaning (as under Rules 14 and 15) of such points as
are not under charge of a yardman. He shall report to the
engine-driver any set of points not under his personal charge
which he finds neglected, as also any defect which he is himself
unable to repair.</p>
<p>26. He shall keep clear all road and field crossing grooves,
and shall at once acquaint the engine-driver when repair to the
surface of any road crossing is necessary.</p>
<p>27. At least once a week he shall walk over the whole length
of the main line and sidings, observing carefully that the keys,
bridge bolts, fish bolts, and sleepers are in order.</p>
<p>28. He shall, at the same time note, and as soon as possible
rectify, all loose sleepers, crooked rails, and defective
superelevation.</p>
<p>29. He shall pay particular attention to the prompt repair of
all parts of the line marked by the engine-driver as defective,
but, independently of such notice, he shall be responsible for
detecting defective places.</p>
<p>30. In regard to any special repairs, or other emergencies of
the traffic, he shall be under the direction and obey the
instructions of the engine-driver.</p>
<p>31. When any part of the line is under repair, care shall be
taken that the surface of the rails is kept clear of ballast
grit, and that the free passage of trains is in no way
obstructed.</p>
<p>32. When it is necessary to remove a sleeper, a red flag shall
be set up between the rails in such a position that the
engine-driver can discern it from a distance of at least 150
yards in each direction. Such flag shall remain until the line is
made good. On no account shall the engine or a loaded wagon pass
over any rail from which a sleeper is removed.</p>
<p>33. If from any cause it is necessary to remove a rail, or
otherwise block the line, the foreman platelayer shall previously
notify the engine-driver, and arrange with him a convenient time
for the work to be done; and without such notification <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the line
shall under no circumstances whatever be so blocked. A red flag
(as directed under Rule 32) shall remain exhibited until the line
is clear.</p>
<p>34. No platelayer other than the foreman shall be authorised
to undertake any work interfering with the free passage of
trains.</p>
<p>35. If, for ballasting or other purposes, wagons are left by
the engine-driver at any point on the main line, such wagons
shall on no account be subsequently moved by hand to any other
point on the main line, except by special arrangement with the
engine-driver.</p>
<p>36. The platelayer&rsquo;s trolley shall under no
circumstances be left standing on the main line and when not in
use, or unattended, the trolley shall always be put at a safe
distance from the line, with the wheels padlocked.</p>
<p>37. The foreman platelayer shall report to the engine-driver
any case of material found deposited within two feet of the rail,
and likewise any other infraction of Regulations which may come
to his notice.</p>
<h4>REGULATIONS FOR ENGINE-DRIVER.</h4>
<p>38. The engine-driver shall be responsible for the efficient
working of the line, and shall use the utmost promptitude in
dealing with the traffic as notified to him by the yardmen.</p>
<p>39. He shall be responsible also for the care of the
locomotive, rolling stock, and fittings appertaining thereto, any
defect in which that is beyond his own power to rectify he shall
at once notify to the Superintendent, with whom any further
responsibility in regard to such defect shall then rest. But the
washing of the wagons and cars shall be done by the yardmen as
set forth under Rule 21.</p>
<p>40. He shall, further, be responsible for the proper oiling of
the axle boxes, spring slides, swivelling forks, and bake gear of
the whole of the rolling stock; and shall on no account run on
the train a loaded wagon having a hot axle box or a bent
axle.</p>
<p>41. He shall see that all rolling stock is kept, as far as
possible, under cover at night and in wet weather.</p>
<p>42. He shall watch carefully that the whole of the line and
its accessories are kept in thorough working order, and shall
direct the foreman platelayer in regard to any part requiring
attention.</p>
<p>43. He shall put down white mark pegs, of which he shall at
all times carry a sufficient supply in the brake van, at all
points of the line which he may notice to be in special need of
repair.</p>
<p>44. He shall arrange with the foreman platelayer, as set forth
under Rule 33, in regard to the time of execution of any work
requiring the blocking of the line.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>45. He
shall promptly enquire into, and report to the Superintendent,
any case of material left within two feet of the rails, as also
any other infraction of the Regulations which may be brought to
his notice. He shall take care that Rule 11, in regard to
passengers by the train, is strictly observed, and shall allow no
person to ride on the engine without permission of the Duke or
from the Estate Office.</p>
<p>46. He shall carefully observe the following County Council
Regulations in regard to crossing the public roads, and shall be
personally liable to the County and District Councils
respectively for the consequences of any infraction
thereof:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>a</i>) Every train about to cross the
road shall be brought to a stand at a point not less than 10 yds.
therefrom, and the brakesman shall proceed to the centre of the
road with a red flag, and shall, as soon as any approaching
vehicles have crossed the railway, wave the said flag as a
warning to distant vehicles and as a sign to the engine-driver to
proceed and shall continue to wave until the whole of the train
shall have passed over the road. After dusk a red lamp shall be
used in place of a flag (but a green light shall be momentarily
shewn to the driver when the road is clear).</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>b</i>) No train shall cross the road at
a greater speed than five miles an hour, nor shall any train
impede the traffic along the road further than is necessary for
the crossing thereof, which shall in no case exceed three
minutes.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>c</i>) Every train crossing the road
shall be in charge of a competent engine-driver and brakesman,
and shall consist of not more than twenty-five vehicles,
exclusive of the engine.</p>
<p>47. He shall take care to run no train without a brake-van at
the rear end, and a brakesman in attendance.</p>
<p>48. He shall at all times whistle before putting his engine in
motion, and also on approaching all road crossings, termini, and
other points where a warning may be desirable. He shall, during
fog, proceed with the utmost caution, particularly in crossing
roads, and shall be ready to stop promptly where cattle may be
upon the line.</p>
<p>49. He shall approach all facing points with caution,
especially after dark, and shall see that his train is well under
control in descending inclines, particularly the gradient by the
Eaton cricket ground.</p>
<p>50. He shall cross the Great Western Siding at Balderton only
when the yard gates are closed, and at dead slow speed, and shall
be personally responsible for any mishap resulting from neglect
of this rule.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>51. He
shall perform no fly-shunting with the engine pushing, and in
draw-shunting he shall proceed with the utmost caution.</p>
<p>52. He shall take care to avoid injury to the rolling stock
from shocks, careless usage, or foul shunting.</p>
<p>53. He shall, between September and February inclusive, carry
on the train all necessary lamps ready trimmed.</p>
<p>54. He shall take care that the breakdown tackle is always
kept ready on the brake van in case of emergency.</p>
<p>55. He shall under no circumstances leave his engine with the
steam up without the hand-brake hard down, the lever out of gear,
and the cylinder cocks open.</p>
<p>56. He shall take care that the spark arrester is kept
effective; the sand boxes full, and that, in conveying
passengers, condensed water is cleared from the cylinders before
starting.</p>
<p>57. He shall keep his engine in good working order, clean, and
smart; executing all necessary repairs at the earliest
opportunity.</p>
<p>58. He shall keep a careful watch that point-lever weights are
left in the right positions, and that the white bars thereon are
kept clearly painted.</p>
<p>59. He shall notify to the Superintendent at the earliest
possible time any requirement for the rolling stock or line, such
as coal, stores, material for repairs, oil, waste, etc., etc.,
and shall keep such booked records of the working as are
required.</p>
<p>60. He shall impress upon the brakesman the following
orders</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>a</i>) To travel always in the
brake-van; to keep a sharp look-out and promptly put down his
brake should occasion require, or on receiving a signal from the
engine.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>b</i>) To carefully watch the loaded
wagons, and in the event of any part of the load appearing
unsafe, to signal at once to the engine-driver to stop the
train.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>c</i>) To carry always on the van a red
flag, and, between September and February inclusive, a hand lamp
ready trimmed, which latter, in travelling after dusk, shall shew
a red light at the back of the train.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>d</i>) To perform shunting operations
with caution, taking care that all point-lever weights are left
in their proper position.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>e</i>) To keep his van clean and smart,
washing it when required.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>f</i>) To carefully observe such of the
Railway Regulations as apply to the brakesman&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h4><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>SIGNALLING REGULATIONS.</h4>
<p>61. The engine-driver shall give three short whistles when he
requires the brake-van brakes to be put down, and one short
whistle when they are to be released. When he requires facing
points to be set for the main line he shall give two, and for a
branch or siding three medium whistles. A whistle continued for
several minutes is a call for assistance, and workmen within
hearing should at once proceed to the spot.</p>
<p>62. A red light is a signal to stop; a green light, to proceed
cautiously; and a white light, to go a-head. In shunting, a green
light, if waved up and down, is a signal to move a-head; if from
side to side, to back.</p>
<p>63. It is important that all persons having to do with
shunting operations should understand that if an engine is either
in contact with no vehicles, or has vehicles both in front and
behind, it is said to go a-head when it moves chimney first, and
to back when it moves fire-box first. If in contact with vehicles
at one end only, it is said to go a-head when it draws and to
back when it pushes such vehicles, without regard to its own
direction.</p>
<h3>D.</h3>
<p>The following rather neat parody, which appeared in a London
evening paper at the time of the passing of the Light Railways
Act, expresses a very reasonable doubt, in which I fully share,
as to the specially beneficial effect of the measure on
agriculture. Fortunately, the Act has been taken very quietly,
and such schemes as have been promoted will, for the most part,
be of considerable general advantage. Certainly there are some
cases in which farmers would be the gainers by a light railway,
but these are an infinitesimal proportion of their whole
number.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THAT TIGHT LITTLE, LIGHT LITTLE</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Non si male nunc et olim<br />
Sic erit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span> farmers, who
lately<br />
Have suffered so greatly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From agricultural depression,<br />
Shake off gloom and sorrow,<br />
A brighter to-morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will dawn in the course of the Session.</p>
<p class="poetry">By no relaxation<br />
Of rates or taxation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By a certain sure-never-to-fail way,<br />
Through Government&rsquo;s pleasure<br />
To bring in a measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For giving some districts a railway:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tight little, light little
railway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nice little,
light little railway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O think of the joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that exquisite toy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tight little,
light little railway.</p>
<p class="poetry">Your wheat may grow cheaper,<br />
The pay of your reaper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May rise to a figure outrageous;<br />
The weather may lay all<br />
Your crops, and your hay all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be ruined by tempests rampageous;<br />
Your stock mayn&rsquo;t grow fatter,<br />
But that does not matter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Except in a bargain and sale way:<br />
What are these to the blessing<br />
Of really possessing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tight little, light little railway?</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">(<i>Chorus</i>.)</p>
<p class="poetry">You may not have a fraction<br />
Of produce for traction,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a stone&rsquo;s weight to put in a wagon,<br />
Not a horse in your stable,<br />
No bread on your table,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a shoe to your foot, not a rag on:<br />
All this would be frightful<br />
Were it not so delightful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see in as-slow-as-a-snail way<br />
The trucks all go gliding<br />
From track into siding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From siding to track on your railway.</p>

<p class="poetry">Then, oh <i>fortunati</i><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait, for the clouds to roll by you:<br />
Your troubles are over;<br />
To-morrow, in clover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll laugh at the ills that now try you.<br

&ldquo;<i>Ex machin&acirc; Deus</i><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in an old-fashioned or stale way.&rdquo;<br />
Let this be your chorus&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;A future&rsquo;s before us;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three cheers for the light little

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
